Millets, and especially pearl millet, also contain high amounts of oxalates that are unsuitable for those with kidney disease and can precipitate kidney stones. They also contain certain enzyme inhibitors and phytic acid, which are called anti-nutrients because they inhibit nutrient absorption unless proper cooking methods are practised. In addition, millets contain protease (trypsin / chymotrypsin) inhibitors, which inhibit enzymatic action to break down proteins and thereby reduce their absorption, as well as cause toxicity in the intestines, potentially leading to leaky gut.
