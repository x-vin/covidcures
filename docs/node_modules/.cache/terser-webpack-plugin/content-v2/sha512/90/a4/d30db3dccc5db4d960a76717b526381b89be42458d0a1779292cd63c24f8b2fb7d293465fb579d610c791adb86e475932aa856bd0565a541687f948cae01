In fact, a majority of patients recovered from the first phase of illness by the sixth day, so much so that even some patients who relapsed had been preparing to return to work very soon. Doxycycline was a drug of choice added to treatment of the first phase of the illness, for its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties through inhibition of protein synthesis and viral replication. Primary contacts were also prophylactically treated with Doxycyclin, which was therefore a mainstay of the treatment.

The longer you leave it, the cascade of mediators will result in other sequalae and culminate into a cytokine storm. But like with other hyper-sensitivity reactions, if caught early, they are easy to cut in. So my entire focus became the eighth day. When patients came into my practice, I would Interrogate them about the onset of the symptoms, the exact day they started feeling unwell. I would then advise them about what might transpire exactly a week later, which is the eighth day, and what symptoms to start looking for. In the second wave, I notice there was a collection of symptoms  that seemed to idle the onset of this hypersensitivity reaction, and not necessarily dyspnea, but body aches and pains. This seemed to be very typical of an allergic reaction, that you would see with rheumatoid arthritis, with joint pain. There was fatigue, to the point that patients wanted to sleep, or the onset of dyspnea. I educated patients about these symptoms, and that they should not discount these symptoms, even if it was a solitary symptom and mild. Any change from the 7th to the 8th day should be reported.” Dr. Chetty reports that a large percentage of patients, about 70 %, did not report any worsening of symptoms on the 8th day, and thus did not enter the second, hypersensitivty phase. However those that did express the hypersensitivity symptoms on the 8th day sometimes advanced to a critical stage in a very short duration of time, needing hospitalization and intensive care in a day or two. Some others had only mild symptoms.

Dr. Chetty's preferred antihistamine was promethazine, a first-generation antihistamine and antipsychotic for its broad diversity of effect, that also is mildly sedative to relieve anxiety in patients who tended to feel it, and which had been used to alleviate sleeping difficulties. This diagnostic approach, of treating dyspnoea as an inflammatory response to Covid than a symptom of Covid, and using an antihistamine in addition to steroids, proved very effective, and patients often began recovery within hours after presenting with dyspnoea. Being hypersensitivity, Monteleukast was added to the therapy on the appearance of symptoms on the 8th day, being a commonly prescribed medication for asthmatic and anaphylactoid reactions, especially where the offending allergen is unknown.

Patients who had taken the vaccines presented with unusual symptoms. With the J&J vaccines, the patients presented with very quick side effects like headaches and other side effects of vaccination, usually a day after vaccination, which took 3-4 days to subside. However with the mRNA vaccines, a large proportion of patients developed Covid-like illness 7-10 days after vaccination, and presented with all the symptoms of Covid- body aches, sore throats, fever etc. Therefore it had become very important to know the vaccination status of patients and note the timeline of onset of illness from the vaccination itself.

Thus, it was concluded that the patients who were presenting with desaturation on the 3rd or 4th day after presenting with symptoms were actually on the 12th or 13th day of the natural disease timeline, since the initial viral phase of the illness was now negated or precluded as these symptoms were not the result of infection but a \"\"spike protein illness\"\" induced in the body by the vaccines. This illness or response to the spike proteins would, if left unchecked, devolve very quickly into a cytokine storm, coagulation problems anda other forms of hyperinflammation. Therefore, the 8th Day Therapy, with antihistamines, Monteleukast, steroids and anticoagulants, was once again recruited to treat patients developing hypoxia and Covid-like symptoms 7-10 days post vaccination.

With some of these cases, perhaps a minority, the patient would look normal on the 8th day, and also on the 9th and 10th, but a few days after the 8th day, when everything seemed fine, the patient would unexpectedly desaturate. In these cases of delayed or deferred desaturation in some vaccinated Covid patients, the desaturation would be rapid and severe and seemed like the most severe of Covid cases that Dr. Chetty had classified. Dr. Chetty therefore conferred with his colleagues in India, who had observed a similar odd evolution of disease pathology in their vaccinated patients, and it is inferred that in the vaccinated patients, the body had developed a measure of tolerance to the spike protein, which delayed the onset of the inflammation and hypersensitivity by a few days, until the initial tolerance was overcome.

Used as directed (i.e., rinsing the mouth and gargling and nasal wash, for 1 minute with prescribed concentrations), Hydrogen peroxide breaks down into water and oxygen in the mouth and is therefore very safe.

As a powerful oxidant, when Ozone comes into contact with blood or other body fluids, it releases reactive oxygen species (ROS), and lipid oxidation products (LOPs) both of which are responsible for the biological results. The main form of ROS is Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which is easily transferred from plasma into the cells. When H2O2 abruptly appears above the threshold medical concentration in the cytoplasm of cells it represents the triggering stimulus for the possibly simultaneous activation of different biochemical pathways in erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets in addition to other numerous biological effects, such as antimicrobial, immunostimulant, and antioxidant ones. H2O2 is then suddenly inactivated into water by the high concentration of Glutathione (GSH), Catalase (CAT), and Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) enzymatic systems, reducing its harmful potential.
