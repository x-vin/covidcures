Patients thus emerge stronger than they were before the treatment, as opposed to mainstream or allopathic treatment protocols, where the side effects of the treatment themselves occasionally cause death or prolonged symptoms.

A correctly designed treatment protocol is found, in fact, to comprehensively treat all underlying conditions of the patient in addition to the SARS-CoV-2. For example, Aswagandha treatment for stress is found to also treat Covid symptoms. There is such a wide range of potential treatment protocols that every physician who has developed their own successful therapeutic strategies for Covid is likely to be using a uniquely different approache.
