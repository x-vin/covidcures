## 1. Arsenicum album 30C (or Arsalb with potency 30), or 200 C for more severe cases; Camphor 1 M

### Objective: 
Prophylactic as well as curative

### System:
Homeopathic

### Can be used alongside other allopathic treatments:
Yes, with the caveat that the patient experiences no discomfort in doing so.

### Status of authorisation:
Homeopathic treatment for Covid, Arsenicum Album, reported to be authorised by the Indian Supreme Court in March, 2020. Both Caamphor 1 M and Arsalb have been approved for use by the Ministry of Ayush. No scientific evidence (from RCT trials) is said to be available but it is well-known amoung communities that use these medications for prophylaxing that they are extremely effective. There exists a considerable body of credible reported evidence from large communities who have used both these treatments, and especially Arsalb, as prophylaxis with great success. Permitted to be used in mainstream treatment only alongside the WHO-protocol, and therefore the outcome of this treatment cannot be known even from available data in widespread clinical trials within mainstream healthcare. 

However, mainstream medicine and media have not come round to acknowledging the efficacy of homeopathic medicine, in the face of tremendous empirical evidence from the communities that use them.

### Protocol and treatment approach:
Homeopaths like Dr. Md Al-Emran Ali of Government Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh, reveal that there are many medicines in homoeopathy, which can be used to treat Covid-19 patients based on similarity of symptoms. “Of the medicines, Rhus Tox, Bryonia Alba, Antimonium Tartaricum or Antim Tart and Camphor are common medicines to treat people infected with the Covid-19 disease,” said Dr. Al-Emran Ali.

**Some principles of homeopathic treatment, as advised by a practising homeopath:**
Homeopaths administer symptomatic treatment that is nonetheless tailored to the physiological context of the individual patient. Thus in homeopathy, the same symptoms may not be prescribed the same remedy in different patients. In the case of the widely prescribed and proven prophylactic Arsalb 30 C, perhaps the underlying reason for its efficacy is due to a common global context created by the pandemic. Arsalb 30 is a preventative, not curative, and is meant to address the common symptoms of cold, fever, sneezing and other ailment due to coronaviruses. Arsalb 30 also engages the parasympathetic nervous system and calms anxiety or fear.

**Prophylactic protocols:**

**Arsenicum Album 30 C:**
There are multiple, slightly different protocols. One of them, for prophylactic treatment, recommends 4 pills **(for adults, 2 pills for children)** for 4 days every 3-4 weeks empty stomach before brushing teeth, after rinsing mouth.

Alternatively, can have 3-4 drops for adults **(1 drop for children)** of liquid Arsalb (potency 30) diluted in 20-30 ml (2-3 tablespoons) of water, instead of the pills.

**Consume no food, tea, coffee or even water for the next 1 hour. Repeat every 3-4 weeks.**

**Camphor 1 M:**
The dosage of Camphor 1 M for adults is four pills half an hour after morning breakfast, four pills half an hour after lunch and four pills half an hour after dinner. The dosage is halved for children. The regimen has to be followed for three days.


**There are no especial dietary precautions to be followed for Arsalb prophylaxing, except to abstain from coffee and tea, and if possible, nonvegetarian food. While prophylaxing with Camphor 1 M, one should avoid consumption of onion, garlic and hing. It is also advisable to not consume anything for half an hour after taking Camphor 1M.**

### Typical duration of treatment:
Recommended to be used continuously as prophylactic.

### Outcome:
Empirical evidence of being highly effective, even in high risk groups, and nearly zero mortality rate in a charitable shelter for destitute and ailing elderly people, among whom about 400 were affected.

### Significant side effects:
Widely used by those who subscribe to homeopathy. No declared side effects even with regular use; no drug interactions with other medicines.

### Recommended quantity for stocking:
Unnecessary to stock as the medicine is commonly available in local homeopathy stores.

### Price:
Very inexpensive, INR 50-60 for 15 ml (half-ounce) bottle, which can be used for prophylaxing for several months

### Suggested suppliers:
Local homeopathy stores or online. One recommended brand is SBL Arsenicum Album 30 CH dilution, bottle of 30 ml dilution, for INR 72. Can be bought online, for example, at www.1mg.com. The SBL brand can also be bought at local stores.

### Status of authorisation:
Homeopathic treatment for Covid was recognized by the Kerala government in various ways, and homeopathic prophylactic medicine has been mass-distributed there since early in the pandemic. There is substantial evidence for homeopathic prophylaxing.
   - [Combating COVID-19: Kerala government distributes Homeopathy medicine to 45 lakh people across the State][17]

The protocol described here is reputed to be used effectively in Dr. Khader Vali's practice, which emphasizes a millet-based diet; Dr. Vali is the highly esteemed Millet Man of India, who has successfully advocated a diet based on millets or Sirudhaanya for improved immunity against all disease.

### Protocol and treatment approach:
**Precautionary measures for prophylaxis or prevention:**

**Homeopathic medicines for immediate and short-term immunity:**
**Bryonia (Alba) 200, Rhus toxicodendron (Rhus tox) 200**
Take 3 pills **(for adults)** of each of these medicines, dissolve in half a glass of water, and consume as far as possible away from meals, i.e., at least half an hour before a main meal. Repeat the dosage 2 times a day, morning and evening, for 3 days.

**Ayurvedic Saptapatra Kashaayas for long-term immunity:**
One can enjoy an everlasting immunity by consuming Saptapatra Kashayas once in every 6 months and Siridhanya or millet grains as staple food.
Prepare a Kashaaya of each of the 7 leaves listed below, one at a time, and consume it for 2 consecutive days. This process would take 7 x 2 = 14 days. Then reiterate the cycle for the next 14 days, and repeat the entire regimen every six months.

**The 7 leaves of the Saptapatra Kashaaya are as follows:**
1. Bermuda grass / Cynodon dactylon / Dhruva or Durva grass
2. Holy basil / Ocimum tenuiflorum / Ocimum sanctum / Tulasi or Tulsi
3. Giloy / Tinospora cordifolia / Amrutavalli or Guduchi
4. Bengal quince or stone apple or wood apple / Aegle Marmelos / Bael or Bilva
5. Indian beech / Pongamia pinnata / Poonga or Karanja or Karum
6. Neem / Azadirachta indica
7. Sacred fig / Ficus religiosa / Peepal

**Structured water and its preparation:**
Structured water is water in which the molecules are organized or structured loosely around hydrophilic cores, or water molecular arrangement that retains memory of its environment. Structured water is claimed to have healing properties. Dr. Vali recommends to create structured water by immersing a copper plate in a mud or steel vessel filled with water for 7 hours or overnight. The water thus prepared is said to have healing properties and can be used for cooking and drinking. The copper plate used must be cleaned daily with tamarind water or lemon and salt.

**Preparation of Kashaaya:**
The Kashaaya or medicinal decoction should ideally be prepared from fresh leaves. Half a fistful of small leaves or 3-4 big leaves should be sufficient for a day's dosage. If the leaves are bought from outside, then they should first be purged of pesticides through a suitable method such as soaking for 10 minutes in 2 % salt water solution, though the method suggested in the protocol is to soak for 10 minutes in a tamarind water solution (20 g tamarind squeezed in 3 litres of structured water), and later rinse off the soaked leaves in structured water. To prepare the Kashaaya, bring 200 ml of structured water to boil, add the leaves to the boiling water, and lower the flame to simmer the water for 2-3 minutes before switching off the flame. Cover the Kashaaya with a lid and allow it to cool for a few minutes. Add palm jaggery syrup if required, and consume it lukewarm.

**Method of preparation of Ambali:**
[Ambali preparation recipe][18]

Grind required quantity of a whole grain millet for 2 seconds in a blender using the Whip mode. Then wash the flour in sufficient water and drain or filter off the water. Soaked the washed broken millet grains for 8 hours in sufficient quantity (2.5 to 3 times the volume of flour) of structured water, to soften the fibre. Then boil the broken grains in the same water, in an open mud pot, until the grains are cooked. After cooking, close the mud pot with a clean cotton cloth and leave to ferment for 8 hours. Add salt to taste before eating.

**Dietary regimen:**
Consume **Ambali** prepared from one of the Sirudhaaniya or millets at least once a day. Subsequently other millet preparations could be consumed as well. There is evidence that sprouting and fermentation reduce the content of antinutrients in the millet bran. Abstain from tea, coffee, alcohol and nonvegetarian and inflammatory foods.

**Some principles of homeopathic treatment, as advised by a practising homeopath:**
Homeopaths administer symptomatic treatment that is nonetheless tailored to the physiological context of the individual patient. Thus in homeopathy, the same symptoms may not be prescribed the same remedy in different patients. In the case of the widely prescribed and proven prophylactic Arsalb 30 C, perhaps the underlying reason for its efficacy is due to a common global context created by the pandemic.

For this reason (that treatment modalities are tailored also to the individual and not merely to symptoms), it is advisable to visit a homeopath in person when there is an ailment. However, in the case of the current prescription, Bryonia 200 is known to prevent pneumonia and Rhus Tox 200 is for body ache. These are administered in the early stage of a disease. Camphor 200 is used to treat fever, when the symptom is present. Like all homeopathic medication, they should be consumed at least half an hour before a main meal, as far as possible on an empty stomach. There are no especial dietary precautions to be followed, except to abstain from coffee and tea, and if possible, nonvegetarian food, and to eat light, easily digestible meals during illness.

### Typical duration of treatment:
1-4 weeks

### Outcome:
Covid prevention, reported relief from symptoms of Covid, post-Covid, a measure of relief from vaccine side effects
