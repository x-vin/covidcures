# An Integrated Approach to Vaccine Recovery

## Notes on Diet
 
### <ins>Millets:</ins>
Millets are found to be less inflammatory than other staple grains and to support immune health better, especially in the context of a Covid-19 prophylactic diet. **Dr. Khadar Vali recommends the consumption of one of the following 5 "Positive Millets" at least once a day while prophylaxing:**
   - Foxtail millet (Tinai)
   - Kodo millet (Varagu)
   - Little millet (Saamai)
   - Barnyard millet (Kuthiravaali in Tamil / Odalu in Telugu)
   - Browntop millet (Pala pul in Tamil / Korralu in Telugu)

However, it may be good not to consume millets in excess as well (i.e., everyday in large quantities, especially when improperly cooked, as explained below) as they can cause stomach ache, bloating and constipation due to their high fibre content, and are also found to contain goitrogenic flavonoids that block iodine absorption and are linked to goitre. Millets, and especially pearl millet, also contain high amounts of oxalates that are unsuitable for those with kidney disease and can precipitate kidney stones. They also contain certain enzyme inhibitors and phytic acid, which are called anti-nutrients because they inhibit nutrient absorption unless proper cooking methods are practised. In addition, millets contain protease (trypsin / chymotrypsin) inhibitors, which inhibit enzymatic action to break down proteins and thereby reduce their absorption, as well as cause toxicity in the intestines, potentially leading to leaky gut. Darker millets are reported to contain more antinutrients.

**Semi-refined millet flour contains less of the antinutrient phytates and oxalates (as the bran contains a higher distribution of these antinutrients) and more bioavailability of iron and calcium, while retaining much of the nutrients. The protease inhibitors can be reduced greatly through soaking and sprouting millets for 5 days prior to consumption, and cooking them with steam or water, rather than dry heating. Another important method to reduce antinutrients in food is fermentation. However, protease inhibitors are also used as antiviral medication as they help block viral replication, and may be helpful as prophylactic if consumed in moderation.**

### <ins>Simple and Effective Way of Vitamin D Supplementation in a Vegan Diet:</ins>
The renowned mycologist Dr. Paul Stamets discovered that the vitamin D levels in the Shiitake mushroom, deemed a superfood for its great benefits to health, soared from about 100 IU / 100 g to 46,000 IU / 100 g when sun-dried for 12 hours over two days, and moreover, that the stored mushrooms preserved significant amounts of the vitamin D2 when tested after an year. It was also discovered that the vitamin D thus produced was as bioavailable as D intake through nutraceutical supplements. (Note: When supplementing vitamin D, it is also important to supplement also with vitamin K2. Furthermore, concurrent Magnesium and Calcium supplementation are necessary to improve D absorption and reap the advantages to bone health, respectively.)

## Notes on the Recommendations to Mitigate Long-Term Effects of Covid-19 mRNA and DNA Vaccines

There have been a plethora of reports, largely broadcast via the Fifth Estate of the informal social communications platforms, about the inacceptably high short term and longer term adverse effects of the novel Covid-19 vaccines. Here are two interviews that might throw light on the true, unimaginable scope and severity of the problem. The interviewee is a prominent researcher Dr. Jessica Rose, whose phenomenal findings from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting Site (VAERS) data were actively suppressed in the public domain:
   - [Gal Shalev Interview with Dr. Jessica Rose- Part 1/2][21]
   - [Gal Shalev Interview with Dr. Jessica Rose- Part 2/2][22]
Of possible longer term severe adverse events, the greatest correlation appears to be with the formation of microclots in the blood, likely in response to the damage to endothelial walls of the cardiovascular system, in addition to other forms of inflammation.

1. The basic anti-inflammatory diet plan (outlined in the leftmost box below) integrates the highly evidence-based recommendations of acclaimed naturopath Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury, PhD, the DIP (Disciplined Intelligent Protocol) Diet, and the well-researched and proven (millet-based) dietary prescriptions of Dr. Khadar Vali, PhD. Both physicians have amassed a reputation for healing thousands of patients of otherwise intractable and debilitating chronic and lifestyle diseases, including diabetes, CVD and cancer, as well as treating thousands of Covid-19 patients, including patients with advanced symptoms, of the infection using diet and integrative holistic therapy alone. The suggested diet and lifestyle have also been greatly informed and inspired by David Wolfe's Spike Protein Protocol.

2. The healthy lifestyle and anti-inflammatory Ayurvedic and herbal medications, here recommended to be adopted along with the proposed diet plan, are derived from evidence-based research in integrative medicine and from the recommendations of the AYUSH Ministry, as well as the long proven and empirical lifestyle and self-care recommendations of acclaimed traditional Nature Cure practitioner Acharya Arun Sharma, grandson and disciple of Acharya Lakshmana Sharma, venerated as a pioneer of naturopathy and Nature Cure in India.

3. The therapy to counter the effect of the induced hyperinflammatory spike proteins from the vaccine, is an integrative approach, combining the most evidence-based and accessible recommendations of homeopathy, Ayurveda and integrative allopathy.

4. Of about 50 different highly effective integrative approaches to Covid-19 treatment surveyed, each of which are known to offer nearly complete cure rate (in this case, a nearly complete efficacy against spike-induced inflammatory response) , the recommendations in the columns below have filtered out and combined a set of integrative strategies that are most aligned with the known effective remedies in naturopathy, homeopathy and Ayurveda, while acknowledging a few extremely effective mainstream protocols as well.

5. Through such an integrative and sustainable approach, seeking to improve and support overall health and immunity, reverse the specific type of long-term inflammation induced by the spike proteins, as well as reverse or mitigate lifestyle diseases- like diabetes, Cardio-Vascular Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, asthma, or even (with diligence and if need be, adjunct holistic therapy) more serious conditions- through time-tested naturopathic and Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle while yet striving to manage inflammation due to the vaccines themselves, we hope to suggest an effective roadmap for individuals to conserve health in the most intelligent and reliable manner, with the help of evidence-based integrative medicine.

6. The recommendations in all 3 columns below may be followed for a best outcome.

Such a diet is especially recommended for those suffering from severe comorbidites, ranging from Cardio-Vascular Disease to cancer, which is treated through the Nature Cure lifestyle protocol. Dinner could be of raw, green salad, cooked lentils like chickpeas (though not recommended by Nature, but in keeping with the principles of the [Ketogenic Diet][56]) or green gram sprouts (possibly with 2-3 tablespoons of vegan mayonnaise or hummus or other healthy relish), or "Kosambari" salads from South India with lentil sprouts. The dinner regimen is inspired by multiple well-known naturopathic regimens in which two meals of the day are grain-free and raw.<br>[Pete Loves Salads:][57] [Kosambari Salads. Just What Is That ? I’ve Got 9 To Show You][58]<br><br>**(Naturopathy)** [<ins>Dr. Biswaroop Rot Chowdhury's DIP Diet:</ins>][59]<br>Another alternative dinner option is the dinner recommended by Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury's DIP Diet. Patients with comorbidities like diabetes, BP, cholesterol, obesity etc. could incorporate the principles of diabetes-reversing dinner outlined in Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury's DIP Diet Plan to reverse them, achieve a controlled blood sugar level without medication and gradually redeem themselves of dependency on medication.<br><br>**The main principle of the DIP lunch and dinner is that the main dish must be preceded by a plate of salad with about as grams of raw vegetables as is equal to 5 times the individual's body weight in kilograms. For a prophylactic diet, the plate of salad vegetables could include a handful of fresh raw (perhaps sprouted) green peas / 2-3 cups of cabbage / 3 bell peppers / 4 fresh raw tomatoes etc. It must be cautioned that tomatoes are not recommended for individuals with compromised kidney function, nor green peas for their protein value.**<br><br>[(DIP Diet) RECIPES To Cure Lifestyle Diseases; Neerja Chowdhury][60]<br><br>Dinner with **cooked whole grain rice or even millets**, preferably nutritious and probiotic [Ambali][61] or Koozhu (fermented broken millet / millet flour congee) or **Pazhankanji (fermented rice congee)**, accompanied by simple lentil gravy and steamed vegetable subzi etc. The fermented grain porridges are prepared by cooking the whole / broken rice grains or millet flour in sufficiently large quantities of water, cooling, and adding split (preferably deseeded) whole green chillies or their highly probiotic stalks alone. Buttermilk (dairy or vegan) and salt could be added for taste before consumption. If lunch consisted of a fermented, probiotic meal, and in cold weather, it might be advisable and a more sustainable choice not to consume probiotic fermented Koozhu or Ambali for dinner, but rice congee or porridge with spiced lentil gravy. The spices of Indian cuisine are very well known to be extremely immune-supportive and anti-inflammatory.<br><br>Dr. Khadar Vali recommends the consumption of the following **5 "Positive Millets"** at least once a day while prophylaxing:<br>**Foxtail millet (Tinai), Kodo millet (Varagu), Little millet (Saamai), Barnyard millet (Kuthiravaali in Tamil / Odalu in Telugu), Browntop millet (Pala pul in Tamil / Korralu in Telugu)**<br>Millet man Dr. Khadar Vali's recommended millet-based dietary regimen for health and prophylaxis.<br>Recommendations and precautions regarding routine millet consumption.<br><br>**A few other superfood options include [Japanese Natto][62] (fermented boiled soybeans, rich in probiotics, calcium, vitamins K, immune-supportive, anticoagulant), and [nutritional yeast or Nori][63] (the latter, an algae commonly used to flavour Asian cuisine) as rich sources of vitamin B12 (among other nutrients) for vegans and vegetarians.**<br><br>**Sweet potatoes** cooked, or sweet potato soup are another flavourful option, as are occasional whole wheat / millet rotis or soba (buckwheat) noodles, quinoa dishes etc.<br><br>**<ins>Note:</ins> Dinner should be consumed before 7 PM, and no food should be eaten on any account after 8 PM.**	| **6:30 - 8:00 PM**			| **6:30 - 8:00 PM**<br><br>(Ayurveda) [<ins>Patanjali's Divya Swasari Coronil Kit:</ins>][64]<br>Primary contacts could consider to take **Patanjali's Divya Swasari Coronil Kit** for the novel coronavirus, which is based on successful clinical trials.<br><br>**<ins>Dosage:</ins>**<br>1.

The evidence-based N.I.C.E. Three-step Flu Diet for Covid-19 recommends to use food to obtain a prophylactic dosage of 0.2 g vitamin C, better absorbed / metabolized through raw fruits and vegetable than artificially as tablets.<br><br>**<ins>Dosage:</ins>**<br>- **An oft suggested nutracuetical option** is to take **500 - 1000 mg of oral vit. C (in powder form or as chewable tablets like LimCee) as prophylactic.**<br><br>- Another recommended protocol prescribes to supplement with 3 g of oral vitamin C 2-3 times a day (adult dosage, 1 g X 2 times in day for children). |
