# An Integrated Early Curative Approach

## Notes on Diet: 
 
Millets:
Millets are found to be less inflammatory than other staple grains and to support immune health better, especially in the context of a Covid-19 prophylactic diet. Dr. Khadar Vali recommends the consumption of one of the following 5 ""Positive Millets"" at least once a day while prophylaxing:
Foxtail millet (Tinai), Kodo millet (Varagu), Little millet (Saamai), Barnyard millet (Kuthiravaali in Tamil / Odalu in Telugu), Browntop millet (Pala pul in Tamil / Korralu in Telugu)

However, it may be good not to consume millets in excess as well (i.e., everyday in large quantities, especially when improperly cooked, as explained below) as they can cause stomach ache, bloating and constipation due to their high fibre content, and are also found to contain goitrogenic flavonoids that block iodine absorption and are linked to goitre. Millets, and especially pearl millet, also contain high amounts of oxalates that are unsuitable for those with kidney disease and can precipitate kidney stones. They also contain certain enzyme inhibitors and phytic acid, which are called anti-nutrients because they inhibit nutrient absorption unless proper cooking methods are practised. In addition, millets contain protease (trypsin / chymotrypsin) inhibitors, which inhibit enzymatic action to break down proteins and thereby reduce their absorption, as well as cause toxicity in the intestines, potentially leading to leaky gut. Darker millets are reported to contain more antinutrients.

Semi-refined millet flour contains less of the antinutrient phytates and oxalates (as the bran contains a higher distribution of these antinutrients) and more bioavailability of iron and calcium, while retaining much of the nutrients. The protease inhibitors can be reduced greatly through soaking and sprouting millets for 5 days prior to consumption, and cooking them with steam or water, rather than dry heating. Another important method to reduce antinutrients in food is fermentation. However, protease inhibitors are also used as antiviral medication as they help block viral replication, and may be helpful as prophylactic if consumed in moderation.

Diet for Chronic Kidney Disease:
Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease should adapt the diet to their requirements with the advice of their consultant physician, as fruits and vegetables in large quantity may not be all suitable to their needs.

Simple and Effective Way of Vitamin D Supplementation in a Vegan Diet:
The renowned mycologist Dr. Paul Stamets discovered that the vitamin D levels in the Shiitake mushroom, deemed a superfood for its great benefits to health, soared from about 100 IU / 100 g to 46,000 IU / 100 g when sun-dried for 12 hours over two days, and moreover, that the stored mushrooms preserved significant amounts of the vitamin D2 when tested after an year. It was also discovered that the vitamin D thus produced was as bioavailable as D intake through nutraceutical supplements. (Note: When supplementing vitamin D, it is also important to supplement also with vitamin K2. Furthermore, concurrent Magnesium and Calcium supplementation are necessary to improve D absorption and reap the advantages to bone health, respectively.)

## Notes on the Therapeutic Approach Suggested in the Early (Asymptomatic / Symptomatic) Treatment Phase: 
 
1. The basic suggested diet plan for mitigating active Covid-19 infection integrates the highly evidence-based recommendations of acclaimed naturopath Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury, PhD- the DIP diet- and the orthogonal (i.e., mutually exclusive) and provenly effective recommendations of many physicians in holistic, traditional and nutritional medicine. It is proposed to adopt as much of this suggested regimen as is comfortably possible when administering self-care at home, and in the early asymptomatic or symptomatic phase of the illness, in order to mitigate the likelihood of the infection progressing to a more severe phase. In addition, there are excellent Ayurvedic, holistic and Integrative medical practitioners who have reported the use of novel natural or holistic therapies to achieve a 100 percent success in cure in their extensive clinical practice. A few of these doctors listed in this document include Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury (Pune), Drs. Sarang Phadke (Pune), Vikram Dravid, and several other physicians who offer the reportedly remarkable Haldi-30 therapy, and Dr. Swapna Reddy (Hyderabad).

2. As these recommendations of Ayurveda, Siddha (Nilavempu / Green chiretta), homeopathy, nutritional medicine and other holistic approaches (including Traditional Chinese Medicine) have been tested and proven efficacious as adjunct therapy to Standard Of Care therapy in outpatient or hospital settings, and as these remedies are effective for any influenza-like disease (especially with respiratory involvement), these simple treatments can be suggested in very safe, nontoxic doses, to be commenced as soon as possible after testing positive or at the earliest sign of symptom onset.

3. Even though the above holistic / herbal / nutritional therapies suggested have each been independently shown in clinical trials to significantly improve patient outcomes, especially when prescribed in early treatment protocols, it is still possible (though clinical trials suggest that it is not probable) that symptomatic infections may not begin to subside after 3 days of treatment. In this case, it is suggested here to add a highly effective and evidence-based but minimally interventive, allopathic protocol like The Zelenko Protocol and Fareed-Tyson Protocol, or FLCCC's very well researched I-MASK+ protocol to the therapy. Another effective option may be the highly evidence-based Fleming Protocol. Yet another treatment option may be the Ippocratic protocol, endorsed by hundreds or thousands of doctors in the EU. Yet another reliable approach might be incorporating the therapeutic strategies suggested by Dr. Shankara Chetty in his 8th Day Therapy, with marked similarities to the Ippocrate protocol. The 8th Day Therapy was one of the first highly successful repurposed allopathic protocols to emerge during the pandemic, proven extremely effective with thousands of outpatients in his residential clinic in South Africa, with not a single mortality in the first and second waves, according to reports of recent months.

4. The following informative website might help to assist the allopathic early treatment protocol adopted, if required. These sites list the most effective pharmaceutical interventions, as well as their rates of efficacy, derived by two different approaches. In the first case, a real-time analysis of a very large number of clinical trials of many popular treatment methods was reviewed. The great majority of these trials were Randomized Controlled Trials. In the second case, the Fleming Method, a patented systematic method of evaluating treatment outcomes was adopted in a sizeable collection of clinical trials across the world, where the method adopted in the trial permitted the physician complete freedom to apply his treatment of choice, using the Fleming Method to assess the differential negative or positive effect of the treatment.

  4.1. COVID-19 early treatment: real-time analysis of 1,081 studies

  From these reviews, it would seem that the most effective allopathic interventions include the following therapies:
    - Androgen-suppressor Proxalutamide (efficacy of 84 % in 10 early treatment and late treatment Randomized Controlled Trials, including a trial with patients on ventilators)
    - Nutraceutical Iota Carrageenan, active ingredient in Betadine Nasal Spray (extract from red seaweed) (effective against a variety of respiratory viruses, 80 % efficacy demonstrated by 1 study in preventing
      asymptomatic early infection from progressing to the symptomatic phase)
    - Nutraceutical Quercetin (nutrient abundant in several herbs, including green tea) (high efficacy of about 80 % demonstrated in 12 early treatment studies)
    - Plant-based integrative medicine, whole seed Nigella sativa / Black cumin (efficacy of 67 % in about 12 clinical trials, including 11 RCTs)
    - Nutraceutical Curcumin (extract from turmeric) (efficacy of about 60 % in 24 early and late treatment clinical trials, including 21 RCTs)
    - Melatonin (efficacy of about 64 % demonstrated in 17 clinical trials, including 10 RCTs)
    - Monoclonal Antibodies Casirivimab / Imdevimab (efficacy ranging from 38 % to 98 % in 4 clinical trials)
    - Povidone-Iodine, the active ingredient in Iodine Nasal Spray (efficacy of 63 % in 19 clinical trials, including 2 RCTs)

  The FLCCC protocols, including I-MASK+ protocol recommended for early outpatient treatment, and I-MATH+ protocol recommended for advanced Covid care in hospital settings, recruit all these recommended medications, among others.

5. With most (or all) of the allopathic treatment modalities, except perhaps the Zelenko early treatment protocol, it would be necessary to connect with a trained physician who can guide through the protocol and prescribe the necessary treatments.
