# An Integrative Prophylactic Protocol

## Notes on Diet: 
 
### Millets:
Millets are found to be less inflammatory than other staple grains and to support immune health better, especially in the context of a Covid-19 prophylactic diet. **Dr. Khadar Vali recommends the consumption of one of the following 5 "Positive Millets" at least once a day while prophylaxing:**
**Foxtail millet (Tinai), Kodo millet (Varagu), Little millet (Saamai), Barnyard millet (Kuthiravaali in Tamil / Odalu in Telugu), Browntop millet (Pala pul in Tamil / Korralu in Telugu)**

Millet man Dr. Khadar Vali's recommended millet-based dietary regimen for health and prophylaxis:<br>
    - [Millet Derived Flavonoids as Potential SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Inhibitors: A Computational Approach; Abhisek Mishra et al.; ChemRxiv; August, 2020][1]

However, it may be good not to consume millets in excess as well (i.e., everyday in large quantities, especially when improperly cooked, as explained below) as they can cause stomach ache, bloating and constipation due to their high fibre content, and are also found to contain goitrogenic flavonoids that block iodine absorption and are linked to goitre. Millets, and especially pearl millet, also contain high amounts of oxalates that are unsuitable for those with kidney disease and can precipitate kidney stones. They also contain certain enzyme inhibitors and phytic acid, which are called anti-nutrients because they inhibit nutrient absorption unless proper cooking methods are practised. In addition, millets contain protease (trypsin / chymotrypsin) inhibitors, which inhibit enzymatic action to break down proteins and thereby reduce their absorption, as well as cause toxicity in the intestines, potentially leading to leaky gut. Darker millets are reported to contain more antinutrients.

**Semi-refined millet flour contains less of the antinutrient phytates and oxalates (as the bran contains a higher distribution of these antinutrients) and more bioavailability of iron and calcium, while retaining much of the nutrients. The protease inhibitors can be reduced greatly through soaking and sprouting millets for 5 days prior to consumption, and cooking them with steam or water, rather than dry heating. Another important method to reduce antinutrients in food is fermentation. However, protease inhibitors are also used as antiviral medication as they help block viral replication, and may be helpful as prophylactic if consumed in moderation.**

### Diet for Chronic Kidney Disease:
Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease should adapt the diet to their requirements with the advice of their consultant physician, as fruits and vegetables in large quantity may not be all suitable to their needs.

### Simple and Effective Way of Vitamin D Supplementation in a Vegan Diet:
The renowned mycologist Dr. Paul Stamets discovered that the vitamin D levels in the Shiitake mushroom, deemed a superfood for its great benefits to health, soared from about 100 IU / 100 g to 46,000 IU / 100 g when sun-dried for 12 hours over two days, and moreover, that the stored mushrooms preserved significant amounts of the vitamin D2 when tested after an year. It was also discovered that the vitamin D thus produced was as bioavailable as D intake through nutraceutical supplements. (Note: When supplementing vitamin D, it is also important to supplement also with vitamin K2. Furthermore, concurrent Magnesium and Calcium supplementation are necessary to improve D absorption and reap the advantages to bone health, respectively.)

## Notes on the Prophylactic Recommendations: 
 
1. **The basic prophylactic diet plan (outlined in the leftmost column below) integrates the highly evidence-based recommendations of acclaimed naturopath Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury, PhD, the DIP (Disciplined Intelligent Protocol) Diet, and the well-researched and proven (millet-based) dietary prescriptions of Dr. Khadar Vali, PhD. Both physicians have amassed a reputation for healing thousands of patients of otherwise intractable and debilitating chronic and lifestyle diseases, including diabetes, CVD and cancer, as well as treating thousands of Covid-19 patients, including patients with advanced symptoms, of the infection using diet and integrative holistic therapy alone.**

2. **It is also very important to adhere to the Ayurvedic diet protocol for mitigating Kapha Dosha, especially for the mid-day meal and afternoon snack. This involves eliminating all dairy products, processed sugar and fried foods from the diet. In following a naturopathic dietary regimen, perhaps an exception might be made in the case of raw fruits and vegetables.**

3. **The healthy lifestyle recommended to be adopted along with the proposed diet plan is derived from the recommendations of the AYUSH Ministry for prophylaxing against Covid-19, as well as the long proven and empirical lifestyle and self-care recommendations of acclaimed traditional Nature Cure practitioner Acharya Arun Sharma, grandson and disciple of Acharya Lakshmana Sharma, venerated as a pioneer of naturopathy and Nature Cure in India.**

4. **The post-exposure prophylactic therapy, particularly for primary contacts, is an integrative approach, combining the most evidence-based and accessible prophylactic recommendations of homeopathy and Ayurveda.**

5. **Of about 50 different highly effective integrative approaches to Covid-19 prevention and treatment surveyed, each of which are known to offer nearly complete cure rate (i.e., negligibly small Case Fatality Rate with the treatment) , the recommendations in the columns below have filtered out and combined a set of integrative strategies that are most aligned with the known effective remedies in naturopathy, homeopathy and Ayurveda, while acknowledging a few extremely effective allopathic protocols (The Zelenko, Fareed-Tyson and I-MASK+ strategies) as viable options.**

6. **Through such an integrative and sustainable prophylactic approach, seeking to improve and support overall health and immunity as well as reverse or mitigate lifestyle diseases- like diabetes, Cardio-Vascular Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, asthma, or even (with diligence) more serious conditions- through time-tested naturopathic and Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle while yet prophylaxing to prevent infection, we hope to suggest an effective roadmap for individuals to prepare for the pandemic in the most intelligent and reliable manner, with the help of evidence-based integrative medicine.**

7. **Persons who are not at high risk of infection, and wishing to adopt a general prophylactic regimen, are recommended to follow the diet and lifestyle prescriptions in the leftmost and middle columns. Those who are at high risk of infection, due to the existence of comorbidities and significant exposure to the virus as primary contacts, are recommended to follow the prescriptions of diet, lifestyle and herbal or nutraceutical supplementation in all three columns.**

Let the pills dissolve slowly in the mouth on the tongue, rather than chewing or swallowing, and do not eat or drink anything (i.e., dry fast) for at least an hour after taking the pills. Do not consume any tea, coffee or nonvegetarian food on the days of dosing with homeopathic medicine. (It is recommended in nature cure to avoid these foods altogether.)|**At or before 5:00 AM**<br><br>**(Homeopathy)** Dr. Khadar Vali's Bryonia + Rhus Tox protocol for primary contacts:<br>**Instead of the Arsenic Album 30 C protocol and if at least 2 weeks have passed since the last Ars Alb regimen**, after significant exposure and for primary contacts, immunity could be also enhanced in the short term, for primary contacts, through Dr. Khadar Vali's prescription of **Bryonia 200 C and Rhus Tox 200 C** could be used.<br><br>**Dosage:**<br>Dissolve 3 each of these pills in half a glass of water, and consume.

Marik's I-MASK+ / I-MASS Protocol:<br>For high-risk primary contacts who would like to adopt an evidence-based allopathic prophylactic regimen in addition to the holistic or traditional protocols, Dr. Marik's preventative Ivermectin regimen is an allopathic alternative, though not recommended by holistic physicians and naturopaths.<br><br>**Contraindications and guidance for prophylaxing with Ivermectin:**<br>Even though widely used and generally considered nontoxic, it must be noted that **Ivermectin is not recommended for children weighing less than 15 kg, for pregnant women and lactating mothers.** Ivermectin should also be avoided by persons with allergic reactions to the drug, compromised kidney or liver function, or those infected with the parasite Loa Loa. There are possibilities of adverse drug interactions with other allopathic or herbal medications. Therefore it is important that Ivermectin should not be used while on any other prophylactic or curative medication without consulting knowledgeable and experienced physicians. **All homeopathic and Ayurvedic therapies should be discontinued at least 2-3 days before beginning an Ivermectin protocol.**<br><br>It must also be noted that several holistic, naturopathic, homeopathic and indigenous / Ayurvedic physicians in India have avowed and demonstrated in their clinical practice that perfect health can be maintained by most, even primary contacts, by starting a holistic prophylactic and healthy diet and lifestyle regimen early and religiously adhering to it, as well as through the Arsenicum album 30 C homeopathic prophylactic protocol mentioned here.<br>- [Moreover, there is evidence from clinical trials suggesting that Ayurvedic medicines taken alone are even more effective than Ayurvedic medicines used as adjunct therapy to a mainstream allopathic treatment modality][24] (including Azithromycin, Vitamin-C and anti-histamines. Acetaminophen, administered as needed).<br><br>Ivermectin prophylactic protocol (Only if desired post-exposure by primary contacts, but not necessary or recommended as primary line of prophylaxis by holistic physicians):<br><br>**<ins>Dosage:</ins>**<br>[*Chronic prevention for high-risk individuals*-<br>0.2 mg / kg per dose, taken with or after meals; first dose at the start of the treatment, repeated after 48 hours, and then 1 dose weekly for as long as risk is elevated in the community]<br><br>**<ins>(Recommended modality of use) Post-exposure Covid prevention:</ins>**<br>0.2 mg / kg per dose, taken with or after meals; first dose at the start of the treatment, repeated after 48 hours<br><br>**<ins>Directions for use:</ins>**<br>**Ivermectin must be had on an empty stomach with a full glass (240 ml) of water,  at least 1 hour before any meal.** The dosage should be determined in consultation with a qualified allopathic physician, and is a function of body weight, underlying medical conditions and response to treatment.|

I’ve Got 9 To Show You][59]<br><br>**(Naturopathy)** [Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury's DIP Diet:][60]<br>Another alternative dinner option is the dinner recommended by Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury's DIP Diet. Patients with comorbidities like diabetes, BP, cholesterol, obesity etc. could incorporate the principles of diabetes-reversing dinner outlined in Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury's DIP Diet Plan to reverse them, achieve a controlled blood sugar level without medication and gradually redeem themselves of dependency on medication.<br><br>**The main principle of the DIP lunch and dinner is that the main dish must be preceded by a plate of salad with about as grams of raw vegetables as is equal to 5 times the individual's body weight in kilograms. For a prophylactic diet, the plate of salad vegetables could include a handful of fresh raw (perhaps sprouted) green peas / 2-3 cups of cabbage / 3 bell peppers / 4 fresh raw tomatoes etc. It must be cautioned that tomatoes are not recommended for individuals with compromised kidney function, nor green peas for their protein value.**<br><br>[(DIP Diet) RECIPES To Cure Lifestyle Diseases; Neerja Chowdhury][61]<br><br>Dinner with **cooked whole grain rice or even millets**, preferably nutritious and probiotic [Ambali][62] or Koozhu (fermented broken millet / millet flour congee) or **Pazhankanji (fermented rice congee)**, accompanied by simple lentil gravy and steamed vegetable subzi etc. The fermented grain porridges are prepared by cooking the whole / broken rice grains or millet flour in sufficiently large quantities of water, cooling, and adding split (preferably deseeded) whole green chillies or their highly probiotic stalks alone. Buttermilk (dairy or vegan) and salt could be added for taste before consumption. If lunch consisted of a fermented, probiotic meal, and in cold weather, it might be advisable and a more sustainable choice not to consume probiotic fermented Koozhu or Ambali for dinner, but rice congee or porridge with spiced lentil gravy. The spices of Indian cuisine are very well known to be extremely immune-supportive and anti-inflammatory.<br><br>Dr. Khadar Vali recommends the consumption of the following **5 "Positive Millets"** at least once a day while prophylaxing:<br>**Foxtail millet (Tinai), Kodo millet (Varagu), Little millet (Saamai), Barnyard millet (Kuthiravaali in Tamil / Odalu in Telugu), Browntop millet (Pala pul in Tamil / Korralu in Telugu)**<br>Millet man Dr. Khadar Vali's recommended millet-based dietary regimen for health and prophylaxis<br>Recommendations and precautions regarding routine millet consumption<br><br>**Sweet potatoes** cooked, or sweet potato soup are another flavourful option, as are occasional whole wheat / millet rotis or soba (buckwheat) noodles, quinoa dishes etc.<br><br>**Note: Dinner should be consumed before 7 PM, and no food should be eaten on any account after 8 PM.**| **6:30 - 8:00 PM-** | **6:30 - 8:00 PM-**<br><br>(Ayurveda) [Patanjali's Divya Swasari Coronil Kit][63]:<br>Primary contacts could consider to take **Patanjali's Divya Swasari Coronil Kit** for the novel coronavirus, which is based on successful clinical trials.<br>**Dosage:**<br>1.
