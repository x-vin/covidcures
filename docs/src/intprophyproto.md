# An Integrative Prophylactic Protocol

## Notes on Diet: 
 
### Millets:
Millets are found to be less inflammatory than other staple grains and to support immune health better, especially in the context of a Covid-19 prophylactic diet. **Dr. Khadar Vali recommends the consumption of one of the following 5 ""Positive Millets"" at least once a day while prophylaxing:**
**Foxtail millet (Tinai), Kodo millet (Varagu), Little millet (Saamai), Barnyard millet (Kuthiravaali in Tamil / Odalu in Telugu), Browntop millet (Pala pul in Tamil / Korralu in Telugu)**

However, it may be good not to consume millets in excess as well (i.e., everyday in large quantities, especially when improperly cooked, as explained below) as they can cause stomach ache, bloating and constipation due to their high fibre content, and are also found to contain goitrogenic flavonoids that block iodine absorption and are linked to goitre. Millets, and especially pearl millet, also contain high amounts of oxalates that are unsuitable for those with kidney disease and can precipitate kidney stones. They also contain certain enzyme inhibitors and phytic acid, which are called anti-nutrients because they inhibit nutrient absorption unless proper cooking methods are practised. In addition, millets contain protease (trypsin / chymotrypsin) inhibitors, which inhibit enzymatic action to break down proteins and thereby reduce their absorption, as well as cause toxicity in the intestines, potentially leading to leaky gut. Darker millets are reported to contain more antinutrients.

**Semi-refined millet flour contains less of the antinutrient phytates and oxalates (as the bran contains a higher distribution of these antinutrients) and more bioavailability of iron and calcium, while retaining much of the nutrients. The protease inhibitors can be reduced greatly through soaking and sprouting millets for 5 days prior to consumption, and cooking them with steam or water, rather than dry heating. Another important method to reduce antinutrients in food is fermentation. However, protease inhibitors are also used as antiviral medication as they help block viral replication, and may be helpful as prophylactic if consumed in moderation.**

### Diet for Chronic Kidney Disease:
Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease should adapt the diet to their requirements with the advice of their consultant physician, as fruits and vegetables in large quantity may not be all suitable to their needs.

### Simple and Effective Way of Vitamin D Supplementation in a Vegan Diet:
The renowned mycologist Dr. Paul Stamets discovered that the vitamin D levels in the Shiitake mushroom, deemed a superfood for its great benefits to health, soared from about 100 IU / 100 g to 46,000 IU / 100 g when sun-dried for 12 hours over two days, and moreover, that the stored mushrooms preserved significant amounts of the vitamin D2 when tested after an year. It was also discovered that the vitamin D thus produced was as bioavailable as D intake through nutraceutical supplements. (Note: When supplementing vitamin D, it is also important to supplement also with vitamin K2. Furthermore, concurrent Magnesium and Calcium supplementation are necessary to improve D absorption and reap the advantages to bone health, respectively.)

## Notes on the Prophylactic Recommendations: 
 
1. **The basic prophylactic diet plan (outlined in the leftmost column below) integrates the highly evidence-based recommendations of acclaimed naturopath Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury, PhD, the DIP (Disciplined Intelligent Protocol) Diet, and the well-researched and proven (millet-based) dietary prescriptions of Dr. Khadar Vali, PhD. Both physicians have amassed a reputation for healing thousands of patients of otherwise intractable and debilitating chronic and lifestyle diseases, including diabetes, CVD and cancer, as well as treating thousands of Covid-19 patients, including patients with advanced symptoms, of the infection using diet and integrative holistic therapy alone.**

2. **It is also very important to adhere to the Ayurvedic diet protocol for mitigating Kapha Dosha, especially for the mid-day meal and afternoon snack. This involves eliminating all dairy products, processed sugar and fried foods from the diet. In following a naturopathic dietary regimen, perhaps an exception might be made in the case of raw fruits and vegetables.**

3. **The healthy lifestyle recommended to be adopted along with the proposed diet plan is derived from the recommendations of the AYUSH Ministry for prophylaxing against Covid-19, as well as the long proven and empirical lifestyle and self-care recommendations of acclaimed traditional Nature Cure practitioner Acharya Arun Sharma, grandson and disciple of Acharya Lakshmana Sharma, venerated as a pioneer of naturopathy and Nature Cure in India.**

4. **The post-exposure prophylactic therapy, particularly for primary contacts, is an integrative approach, combining the most evidence-based and accessible prophylactic recommendations of homeopathy and Ayurveda.**

5. **Of about 50 different highly effective integrative approaches to Covid-19 prevention and treatment surveyed, each of which are known to offer nearly complete cure rate (i.e., negligibly small Case Fatality Rate with the treatment) , the recommendations in the columns below have filtered out and combined a set of integrative strategies that are most aligned with the known effective remedies in naturopathy, homeopathy and Ayurveda, while acknowledging a few extremely effective allopathic protocols (The Zelenko, Fareed-Tyson and I-MASK+ strategies) as viable options.**

6. **Through such an integrative and sustainable prophylactic approach, seeking to improve and support overall health and immunity as well as reverse or mitigate lifestyle diseases- like diabetes, Cardio-Vascular Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, asthma, or even (with diligence) more serious conditions- through time-tested naturopathic and Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle while yet prophylaxing to prevent infection, we hope to suggest an effective roadmap for individuals to prepare for the pandemic in the most intelligent and reliable manner, with the help of evidence-based integrative medicine.**

7. **Persons who are not at high risk of infection, and wishing to adopt a general prophylactic regimen, are recommended to follow the diet and lifestyle prescriptions in the leftmost and middle columns. Those who are at high risk of infection, due to the existence of comorbidities and significant exposure to the virus as primary contacts, are recommended to follow the prescriptions of diet, lifestyle and herbal or nutraceutical supplementation in all three columns.**
