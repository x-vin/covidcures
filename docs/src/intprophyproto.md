# An Integrative Prophylactic Protocol

## Notes on Diet: 
 
### Millets:
Millets are found to be less inflammatory than other staple grains and to support immune health better, especially in the context of a Covid-19 prophylactic diet. **Dr. Khadar Vali recommends the consumption of one of the following 5 ""Positive Millets"" at least once a day while prophylaxing:**
**Foxtail millet (Tinai), Kodo millet (Varagu), Little millet (Saamai), Barnyard millet (Kuthiravaali in Tamil / Odalu in Telugu), Browntop millet (Pala pul in Tamil / Korralu in Telugu)**

However, it may be good not to consume millets in excess as well (i.e., everyday in large quantities, especially when improperly cooked, as explained below) as they can cause stomach ache, bloating and constipation due to their high fibre content, and are also found to contain goitrogenic flavonoids that block iodine absorption and are linked to goitre. Millets, and especially pearl millet, also contain high amounts of oxalates that are unsuitable for those with kidney disease and can precipitate kidney stones. They also contain certain enzyme inhibitors and phytic acid, which are called anti-nutrients because they inhibit nutrient absorption unless proper cooking methods are practised. In addition, millets contain protease (trypsin / chymotrypsin) inhibitors, which inhibit enzymatic action to break down proteins and thereby reduce their absorption, as well as cause toxicity in the intestines, potentially leading to leaky gut. Darker millets are reported to contain more antinutrients.

**Semi-refined millet flour contains less of the antinutrient phytates and oxalates (as the bran contains a higher distribution of these antinutrients) and more bioavailability of iron and calcium, while retaining much of the nutrients. The protease inhibitors can be reduced greatly through soaking and sprouting millets for 5 days prior to consumption, and cooking them with steam or water, rather than dry heating. Another important method to reduce antinutrients in food is fermentation. However, protease inhibitors are also used as antiviral medication as they help block viral replication, and may be helpful as prophylactic if consumed in moderation.**

### Diet for Chronic Kidney Disease:
Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease should adapt the diet to their requirements with the advice of their consultant physician, as fruits and vegetables in large quantity may not be all suitable to their needs.

### Simple and Effective Way of Vitamin D Supplementation in a Vegan Diet:
The renowned mycologist Dr. Paul Stamets discovered that the vitamin D levels in the Shiitake mushroom, deemed a superfood for its great benefits to health, soared from about 100 IU / 100 g to 46,000 IU / 100 g when sun-dried for 12 hours over two days, and moreover, that the stored mushrooms preserved significant amounts of the vitamin D2 when tested after an year. It was also discovered that the vitamin D thus produced was as bioavailable as D intake through nutraceutical supplements. (Note: When supplementing vitamin D, it is also important to supplement also with vitamin K2. Furthermore, concurrent Magnesium and Calcium supplementation are necessary to improve D absorption and reap the advantages to bone health, respectively.)

## Notes on the Prophylactic Recommendations: 
 
1. **The basic prophylactic diet plan (outlined in the leftmost column below) integrates the highly evidence-based recommendations of acclaimed naturopath Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury, PhD, the DIP (Disciplined Intelligent Protocol) Diet, and the well-researched and proven (millet-based) dietary prescriptions of Dr. Khadar Vali, PhD. Both physicians have amassed a reputation for healing thousands of patients of otherwise intractable and debilitating chronic and lifestyle diseases, including diabetes, CVD and cancer, as well as treating thousands of Covid-19 patients, including patients with advanced symptoms, of the infection using diet and integrative holistic therapy alone.**

2. **It is also very important to adhere to the Ayurvedic diet protocol for mitigating Kapha Dosha, especially for the mid-day meal and afternoon snack. This involves eliminating all dairy products, processed sugar and fried foods from the diet. In following a naturopathic dietary regimen, perhaps an exception might be made in the case of raw fruits and vegetables.**

3. **The healthy lifestyle recommended to be adopted along with the proposed diet plan is derived from the recommendations of the AYUSH Ministry for prophylaxing against Covid-19, as well as the long proven and empirical lifestyle and self-care recommendations of acclaimed traditional Nature Cure practitioner Acharya Arun Sharma, grandson and disciple of Acharya Lakshmana Sharma, venerated as a pioneer of naturopathy and Nature Cure in India.**

4. **The post-exposure prophylactic therapy, particularly for primary contacts, is an integrative approach, combining the most evidence-based and accessible prophylactic recommendations of homeopathy and Ayurveda.**

5. **Of about 50 different highly effective integrative approaches to Covid-19 prevention and treatment surveyed, each of which are known to offer nearly complete cure rate (i.e., negligibly small Case Fatality Rate with the treatment) , the recommendations in the columns below have filtered out and combined a set of integrative strategies that are most aligned with the known effective remedies in naturopathy, homeopathy and Ayurveda, while acknowledging a few extremely effective allopathic protocols (The Zelenko, Fareed-Tyson and I-MASK+ strategies) as viable options.**

6. **Through such an integrative and sustainable prophylactic approach, seeking to improve and support overall health and immunity as well as reverse or mitigate lifestyle diseases- like diabetes, Cardio-Vascular Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, asthma, or even (with diligence) more serious conditions- through time-tested naturopathic and Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle while yet prophylaxing to prevent infection, we hope to suggest an effective roadmap for individuals to prepare for the pandemic in the most intelligent and reliable manner, with the help of evidence-based integrative medicine.**

7. **Persons who are not at high risk of infection, and wishing to adopt a general prophylactic regimen, are recommended to follow the diet and lifestyle prescriptions in the leftmost and middle columns. Those who are at high risk of infection, due to the existence of comorbidities and significant exposure to the virus as primary contacts, are recommended to follow the prescriptions of diet, lifestyle and herbal or nutraceutical supplementation in all three columns.**

For a prophylactic diet, the plate of salad vegetables could include a handful of fresh raw (preferably sprouted) green peas / four fresh raw tomatoes.**<br><br>(DIP Diet) RECIPES To Cure Lifestyle Diseases; Neerja Chowdhury<br><br>Lunch with cooked whole grain rice or millets, preferably nutritious and probiotic Ambali or Koozhu (fermented broken millet / millet flour congee) or Pazhankanji (fermented rice congee), accompanied by simple lentil gravy and steamed vegetable Subzi, spiced buttermilk / milk Kefir etc. The fermented grain porridges are prepared by cooking the grains or flour in sufficiently large quantities of water, cooling, and adding split (preferably deseeded) whole green chillies or their highly probiotic stalks alone. Buttermilk (dairy or vegan) too could be added to assist better fermentation. Those who are trying to reverse vitamin D deficiency are recommended to consume 100 - 200 g sun-dried mushrooms (preferably the highly nutritious Shiitake mushrooms) a week, by having several 3-4 servings of sun-dried mushrooms (soaked and cooked) weekly. Shiitake mushrooms that have been sun-dried for 12 hours with their gills facing up and dehydrated and packed, have been demonstrated to provide 46,000 IU of vitamin D per 100 g.<br><br>Dr. Khadar Vali recommends the consumption of one of the following **5 "Positive Millets" at least once a day while prophylaxing:**

| **4 PM-**<br><br>(Naturopathy) Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury's DIP Diet:<br>**Very light snack, if required, but only steamed snacks, not fried. A few examples** of good light snacks are a small quantity of millet ""Pidi"" or steamed millet flour dumplings in coconut milk, ""Ada"" or ""Modak"" with tasty fillings like coconut + palm sugar / palm jaggery and prepared on plantain leaves, Ragi + Murungai Keerai roti, 1 millet or other dosa with boiled or sprouted green gram + coconut + jaggery filling, a small quantity of millet pongal with ghee + raisins + almonds + cashewnuts, a small quantity of millet / buckwheat pasta with steamed broccoli + carrots + beans, amaranth snacks, homemade oats ""energy bar"" with sprouted nuts.<br><br>**The light snack is suggested principally for those who to prefer to have a dinner consisting only of raw salad. Those who are practising the DIP diet are recommended to have only fresh fruits, dry fruits / nuts soaked for at least 4-5 hours and other light raw snacks in the prescribed small quantity.**<br><br>**(Ayurveda, Naturopathy) Herbal tea or Kashaya:**<br>This light snack should preferably be accompanied by **1-2 cups of an immunity-boosting herbal decoctions or teas as prophylactic**, such as the following:<br>Ayush Kwath Churna, from Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala<br>A variety of anti-inflammatory teas, informed by indigenous medicine as well as science<br><br>Persons with comorbidities like diabetes, BP, cholesterol, obesity etc. could incorporate the principles of diabetes-reversing afternoon snacking outlined in Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury's DIP Diet Plan to reverse these inflammatory diseases, achieve a controlled blood sugar level without medication and gradually redeem themselves of dependency on medication.| | |

| **4:00 - 4:30 PM-**| | |	
| | | |
| **6:30 - 8:00 PM-**<br><br>**(Nature Cure / Naturopathy)** Acharya Arun Sharma's dietary recmomendations in Nature Cure:<br>According to Acharya Arun Sharma's philosophy of Nature Cure, in the tradition of his Guru and grandfather, Acharya Lakshmana Sharma, at least two meals in a raw should be consumed in the raw form. Such a diet is especially recommended for those suffering from severe comorbidites, ranging from Cardio-Vascular Disease to cancer, which is treated through the Nature Cure lifestyle protocol. Dinner could be of raw, green salad, cooked lentils like chickpeas (though not recommended by Nature, but in keeping with the principles of the Ketogenic Diet) or green gram sprouts (possibly with 2-3 tablespoons of vegan mayonnaise or hummus or other healthy relish), or ""Kosambari"" salads from South India with lentil sprouts. The dinner regimen is inspired by multiple well-known naturopathic regimens in which two meals of the day are grain-free and raw.<br>Pete Loves Salads: Kosambari Salads. Just What Is That ? I’ve Got 9 To Show You<br><br>**(Naturopathy)** Dr. Biswaroop Rot Chowdhury's DIP Diet:<br>Another alternative dinner option is the dinner recommended by Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury's DIP Diet.

Buttermilk (dairy or vegan) and salt could be added for taste before consumption. If lunch consisted of a fermented, probiotic meal, and in cold weather, it might be advisable and a more sustainable choice not to consume probiotic fermented Koozhu or Ambali for dinner, but rice congee or porridge with spiced lentil gravy. The spices of Indian cuisine are very well known to be extremely immune-supportive and anti-inflammatory.<br><br>Dr. Khadar Vali recommends the consumption of the following **5 "Positive Millets"** at least once a day while prophylaxing:<br>**Foxtail millet (Tinai), Kodo millet (Varagu), Little millet (Saamai), Barnyard millet (Kuthiravaali in Tamil / Odalu in Telugu), Browntop millet (Pala pul in Tamil / Korralu in Telugu)**<br>Millet man Dr. Khadar Vali's recommended millet-based dietary regimen for health and prophylaxis<br>Recommendations and precautions regarding routine millet consumption<br><br>**Sweet potatoes** cooked, or sweet potato soup are another flavourful option, as are occasional whole wheat / millet rotis or soba (buckwheat) noodles, quinoa dishes etc.<br><br>**Note: Dinner should be consumed before 7 PM, and no food should be eaten on any account after 8 PM.**| | |
