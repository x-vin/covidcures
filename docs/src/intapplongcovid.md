# An Integrated Approach to Long-Covid Therapy

## Notes on Diet 
 
### <ins>Millets:</ins>
Millets are found to be less inflammatory than other staple grains and to support immune health better, especially in the context of a Covid-19 prophylactic diet. **Dr. Khadar Vali recommends the consumption of one of the following 5 "Positive Millets" at least once a day while prophylaxing:**
**Foxtail millet (Tinai), Kodo millet (Varagu), Little millet (Saamai), Barnyard millet (Kuthiravaali in Tamil / Odalu in Telugu), Browntop millet (Pala pul in Tamil / Korralu in Telugu)**

However, it may be good not to consume millets in excess as well (i.e., everyday in large quantities, especially when improperly cooked, as explained below) as they can cause stomach ache, bloating and constipation due to their high fibre content, and are also found to contain goitrogenic flavonoids that block iodine absorption and are linked to goitre. Millets, and especially pearl millet, also contain high amounts of oxalates that are unsuitable for those with kidney disease and can precipitate kidney stones. They also contain certain enzyme inhibitors and phytic acid, which are called anti-nutrients because they inhibit nutrient absorption unless proper cooking methods are practised. In addition, millets contain protease (trypsin / chymotrypsin) inhibitors, which inhibit enzymatic action to break down proteins and thereby reduce their absorption, as well as cause toxicity in the intestines, potentially leading to leaky gut. Darker millets are reported to contain more antinutrients.

**Semi-refined millet flour contains less of the antinutrient phytates and oxalates (as the bran contains a higher distribution of these antinutrients) and more bioavailability of iron and calcium, while retaining much of the nutrients. The protease inhibitors can be reduced greatly through soaking and sprouting millets for 5 days prior to consumption, and cooking them with steam or water, rather than dry heating. Another important method to reduce antinutrients in food is fermentation. However, protease inhibitors are also used as antiviral medication as they help block viral replication, and may be helpful as prophylactic if consumed in moderation.**

### <ins>Simple and Effective Way of Vitamin D Supplementation in a Vegan Diet:</ins>
The renowned mycologist Dr. Paul Stamets discovered that the vitamin D levels in the Shiitake mushroom, deemed a superfood for its great benefits to health, soared from about 100 IU / 100 g to 46,000 IU / 100 g when sun-dried for 12 hours over two days, and moreover, that the stored mushrooms preserved significant amounts of the vitamin D2 when tested after an year. It was also discovered that the vitamin D thus produced was as bioavailable as D intake through nutraceutical supplements. (Note: When supplementing vitamin D, it is also important to supplement also with vitamin K2. Furthermore, concurrent Magnesium and Calcium supplementation are necessary to improve D absorption and reap the advantages to bone health, respectively.)

## Notes on the Recommendations to Mitigate Long-Covid
Harvard Health: [The Tragedy of Long Covid][21] 
Dr. Bruce Patterson, MD: [A rationale for the mechanism of lond-Covid][22]

1. The basic diet plan (outlined in the leftmost column below) integrates the highly evidence-based recommendations of acclaimed naturopath Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury, PhD, the DIP (Disciplined Intelligent Protocol) Diet, and the well-researched and proven (millet-based) dietary prescriptions of Dr. Khadar Vali, PhD. Both physicians have amassed a reputation for healing thousands of patients of otherwise intractable and debilitating chronic and lifestyle diseases, including diabetes, CVD and cancer, as well as treating thousands of Covid-19 patients, including patients with advanced symptoms, of the infection using diet and integrative holistic therapy alone.

2. It is also very important to adhere to the Ayurvedic diet protocol for mitigating Kapha Dosha, especially for the mid-day meal and afternoon snack. This involves eliminating all dairy products, processed sugar and fried foods from the diet. In following a naturopathic dietary regimen, perhaps an exception might be made in the case of raw fruits and vegetables.

3. The healthy lifestyle recommended to be adopted along with the proposed diet plan is derived from the recommendations of the AYUSH Ministry, as well as the long proven and empirical lifestyle and self-care recommendations of acclaimed traditional Nature Cure practitioner Acharya Arun Sharma, grandson and disciple of Acharya Lakshmana Sharma, venerated as a pioneer of naturopathy and Nature Cure in India.

4. The long-Covid treatment approach outlined here is an integrative approach, combining recommendations of homeopathy and Ayurveda that are supported by some acknowledged authority. Of about 50 different highly effective integrative approaches to Covid-19 prevention and treatment surveyed, each of which are known to offer nearly complete cure rate (i.e., negligibly small Case Fatality Rate with the treatment) , the recommendations in the columns below have filtered out and combined a set of integrative strategies that are most aligned with the known effective remedies in naturopathy, homeopathy, Ayurveda and allopathy and integrative medicine.

5. With regard to this treatment strategy, the recommendations in all 3 columns may be followed for best outcome.

6. Through such an integrative and sustainable approach, seeking to improve and support overall health and immunity and reverse the long-term damage caused by hyperinflammation, as well as reverse or mitigate lifestyle diseases- like diabetes, Cardio-Vascular Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, asthma, or even (with diligence) more serious conditions- through time-tested naturopathic and Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle, we hope to suggest an effective roadmap for individuals to recuperate fully in the most intelligent and reliable manner, with the help of evidence-based integrative medicine.

7. If the protocol suggested here has not been effective enough, there are other reportedly highly effective but lesser known therapies, especially alternate therapies, which have proven dramatically effective in the treatment of long-Covid in a relatively small number of clinical trials. These therapies include the following options:
   i. [Ozone therapy][24], described in more detail in a later section
   ii. The Niatonin (Niacin + Melatonin) Protocol, by Dr. Dmitry Kats, PhD,
   iii. NICE (Network of Influenza Care Experts) Helpline (+91 8587059169)
   iv. Chlorine Dioxide Solution therapy and Physicians supporting CDS therapy
   v. Haldi30 patented herbal extract and Physicians offering Haldi30 treatment
   vi. Ayurvedic Physicians offering extremely efficacious treatment

| **9 AM-**<br><br>(Naturopathy)<br>**Everyday, whenever other herbal kashayas are not being consumed at this time (on an empty stomach) in the morning**, drink 200 ml of [green juice][27] prepared from cucumber / ash gourd / bottle gourd / [plantain pith or stem][28] / [mint leaves][29] / [wheatgrass][30] / [Moringa leaves / corriander leaves][31], in rotation, and with [Amla][32], fresh lemon juice and a teaspoon of honey for taste. Naturopathy importantly utilizes this therapy [to counter systemic inflammation.][33]<br><br>**OR**<br><br>(Herbal / Natural Medicine, Dr. Khadar Vali) Saptapatra (Seven leaves) Kashaya Immunity regimen:<br>**Instead of the green juice, and for those who can source the fresh medicinal leaves in their locality**, for 4 weeks every 6 months, follow the [Saptapatra Kashaaya regimen][34] recommended by Dr. Khadar Vali, with 20 ml of the Kashaaya of one of the leaves of the following **seven medicinal plants: 1) Neem , 2) Tulasi, 3) Koovalam or Bael or wood apple, 4) Guduchi or Amrutavalli or Giloy, 5) Arayaal or Peepal or Pippala or sacred fig, 6) Karuka Pullu or Dhruva or Bermuda grass, 7) Poonga or Karanja or Indian beech.** Prepare a Kashaaya of each of the 7 leaves listed, one at a time, and consume it for 2 consecutive days.

Then reiterate the cycle for the next 14 days, and repeat the entire regimen every six months.<br><br>**Contraindication**:<br>**The Saptapatra Kashaaya regimen had better not be followed on the days that the homeopathic protocols are being administered, and it is better to avoid the green juice protocol during the 28 days that the Saptapatra Kashaaya regimen is adopted**, so as to have the herbal juices on empty stomach and to reduce interference with other medications.| **9 AM-**			| **9 AM-**<br><br>(Siddha)<br>Primary contacts can drin 60 ml (about 0.25 - 0.5 glass) of [Kapasura + Nilavembu Kudineer][35], on an empty stomach once in 3-4 days (or on a cycle of 5 consecutive days every two weeks).<br><br>**Two recommended methods of preparation and dosages:**<br>A veteran traditional physician Sh. Maragathamani recommends to drink a tumbler of Kudineer, prepared by adding 1 teaspoon each of Nilavembu and Kapasura boiled in two tumblers of water down to one tumbler (and optionally, a pinch of alum powder added), thrice a week.<br><br>According to customary instructions provided on packets, **1 teaspoon of one of these (Kapasoora / Nilavempu) herb powders added to 2 tumblers of water and boiled down to half a tumbler (approx. 60 ml)**.<br><br>**Dosage**:<br>As with prophylaxing, Kapasura / Nilavembu Kudineer may be consumed 1-2 times a day on empty stomach for a week in 1 cycle. The cycle is then repeated after a gap of about 10 days (or 1-2 weeks). In practice, the bitter decoction is drunk by most people less frequently, about 1-3 times a week as self-medication in longer term use.|
