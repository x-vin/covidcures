## 1. [Kapasoora Kudineer, Nilavempu][1] (Indian echinacea / Green chiretta / Kaalamegha) Kudineer, Panchamoola (called Panchtikta Kwath Choorna in Ayurveda) Kudineer

### Objective: 
Prophylactic, curative, known to clear respiratory tract and boost immunity, especially against viruses

### System:
Tamil Siddha

### Can be used alongside other allopathic treatments:
Yes, with the caveat that the patient experiences no discomfort in doing so.

### Status of authorisation:
Revealed by a govt.-certified reputed traditional Siddha practitioner, Ayya Maragathamani; promoted widely by TN government as prophylactic and cure for affected persons in quarantine.

The dried powder of stem and leaves of Fah talai jone or Green chiretta (Andrographis paniculata) has been widely used for centuries in Thailand and some neighboring countries as a treatment for acute respiratory tract infection and to reduce inflammation and coughing. Evidence-based data from clinical trials in Thailand suggest that the treatment is reported to have been effectively used to treat over 69,000 prisoners with Covid-19 in a large-scale clinical trial. The prisoners themselves work to grow the crop, harvest, dry and grind the mature stem into a dark green powder, which is then packed in capsules to be shipped to other prisons. In July, 2021, Thailand's cabinet approved Green chiretta for use in people with asymptomatic or mild coronavirus infections following a successful trial in prisons.

### Protocol and treatment approach:

   2. Chrysopogon zizanoides (L.) Roberty / Vettiver / Kuruveru / Khus / Cuscus grass / Raamatcham (Root)
   3. Santalum album L. / Sandanam / Chandanam / Indian sandalwood (Bark)

According to packets, **1 teaspoon of one of these (Kapasoora / Nilavempu) herb powders added to 2 tumblers of water and boiled down to half a tumbler, consumed twice a day on empty stomach. In practice, drunk less frequently.**

The bitter decoction was given freely by TN government to poor colonies who could not practice social distancing. **The veteran traditional physician Maragathamani recommends to drink a tumbler of 1 teaspoon each of Nilavembu and Kapasoora herbal powders boiled in two tumblers of water down to one tumbler** and (optionally) a pinch of alum powder added, **thrice a week**. However, ordinary people themselves suggest to drink the concentrated drink once or at most twice a week on empty stomach for prophylaxing.

### Typical duration of treatment:
Continuously, when used as prophylactic. Each treatment cycle lasts 4-5 days and is repeated monthly, i.e. about three weeks after the end of the last course.

### Outcome:
As usual, official statistics are hard to find on alternate or holistic remedies. The medicine is well-known traditional treatment for respiratory conditions. Official Covid mortality statistics in Tamil Nadu, where this protocol was used widely in a mild form as prophylactic and treatment for mild cases, was around the nationwide average of 1.5 percent, but India itself had a relatively very low mortality rate, perhaps due to widespread use of indigenous medicine for treatment. Reporting of covid cases too varies from State to State, and may have been grossly "underreported" in Tamil Nadu.

### Significant side effects:
[No apparent side effects even to regular users.][4] However Nilavempu or Indian echinacea is known in Ayurveda to cause dizziness, heart palpitations and infertility in higher doses. **Pregnant women are recommended not to have it.**

### Recommended quantity for stocking:
100 g each of Nilavempu and Kapasoora kudineer, Padigaaram or alum salt in minimum quantity sold. Panchtikta kwatha choorna from Ayurvedic pharmacies too can be stocked.

### Price:
Nilavembu / Kapasoora Kudineer powders cost INR 60-70 for 50 g, INR 10 for salt Padigaram in Naattu Marunthu Kadai. Popular brands of Ayurvedic Panchtikta Kwatha Choorna cost between about INR 150 to INR 750 for 100 g bottle.

### Suggested suppliers:
All Siddha or Ayurveda shops, and Naattu Marunthu Kadai in TN, like Impcops in Chennai, and a number of online suppliers as well

During an earlier outbreak of Dengue, Chikungunya and Swine flu in Tamil Nadu, India, Kabasura Kudineer and Nilavembu Kudineer were used to control the febrile episodes. The following interesting cross-sectional survey conducted among 200 participants (80.5 % urban, and 19.5 % rural) indicated that people use Kabasura Kudineer because they find allopathic medicine to be less effective, and the study outcome suggests that Kabasura Kudineer is taken as a self-medication among Tamil Nadu people:

## 3. Miscellaneous excellent therapies in Ayurveda and Siddha
					
### Objective: 
Mitigation

### System:
Tamil Siddha

### Can be used alongside other allopathic treatments:
Yes, but the conventional therapy may defeat the purpose of these medications

If the patient has not recovered in three days, a certain Siddha treatment is begun, and if that fails, there is yet another extremely effective Siddha remedy that cures with a single dose. These Siddha remedies were not revealed.

2. **Jeevanthyaadi kashayam with Vilvaadi gulam**

3. **Shadanga kashayam with powdered Mruthyanjaya gulam**

### Typical duration of treatment:
3-7 days
