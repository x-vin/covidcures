It is found to be effective in fevers of unknown etiology, filarial lymphangitis and derangement of liver function besides its anti -malarial activity. Various Ayurveda classics describe activities and properties of the ingredients of AYUSH-64 in respiratory diseases and also acute infectious diseases with pulmonary complications. "

## 3. Sh. Bonigi Anandaiah's Ayurvedic treatment for Covid-19 in Krishnapatnam village, Nellore district, Andhra Pradesh				
### Objective: 
**VACANT**

### System:
Ayurveda / Indigenous

### Can be used alongside other allopathic treatments:
Perhaps yes, as this has not been specifically mentioned in reports

### Status of authorisation:
Authorized to treat for Covid by the Andhra Pradesh government, but Sh. Bonigi is reportedly not a physician by training. It is said that the knowledge of this reportedly wonderful herbal therapy was given to him by a wandering traditional mendicant, and prepared and shared by him with many others.

### Protocol and treatment approach:
**The protocol is said to involve three forms of therapeutic medication:**

1. **Preventative / prophylactic oral medication, administered over 5 successive days, with the recommendation not to consume any animal protein or alcohol during that period**
2. **Curative medication to address symptoms for affected patients in the early stages of the disease**
3. **Medication in the form of eye drops for those in critical stages of the illness.**

### Typical duration of treatment:
Rapid recovery, reportedly often in under 5 days

### Outcome:
It is reported in media that patients from far away cities have travelled to receive the treatment, and that thousands of patients have been treated so far with not a single fatality. Video documentaries testify that thousands of patients, many in the critical stages of the disease, flock to the treatment centre, and benefit very quickly.

### Significant side effects:
Not many known, though a few people have been affected by conjunctivitis after being administered the eye drops.

### Recommended quantity for stocking:
The medicine cannot be refrigerated and therefore cannot be stocked in advance of a few days.

### Price:
The medicine is extremely inexpensive and costs INR 10. For distance deliveries, shipping is charged. Distance orders are undertaken when orders are placed by a group of 10-50 people, in which case INR 50/- is charged for shipping per group of four people.

### Suggested suppliers:
The medicines can only be bought from the physician Sh. Anandaiah himself, in the coastal village Krishnapatnam of AP. Distance deliveries are undertaken by post, and the medications should be consumed within 15 days of arrival. They are sent in a dry and powdery form and should not be refrigerated.

## 5. Ayush Kwath Churna:

(**Tulsi** / Holy Basil / Ocimum sanctum,

Dalchini / **Cinnamon** / Cinnamomum zeylanicum,

Sunthi / **Ginger** / Zingiber officinale and

Marich / **Black Pepper** / Piper nigrum)"

### Objective: 
Supporting and enhancing immunity. Primarily prophylactic.

### System:
Ayurveda

### Can be used alongside other allopathic treatments:
Yes, alongside non-Ayurvedic prophylactic treatments

### Status of authorisation:
Kottakkal, situated in Kerala, is one of the most traditional and reputed centres of traditional and hereditary Ayurvedic treatment in India.

The Ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy) recommended the public to use a herbal decoction as an immunity-enhancing measure against the novel coronavirus in April, 2020. The ministry claimed that ‚ÄòAYUSH KWATH‚Äô formulation can help boost the immune system, the body‚Äôs first line of defense against bacteria and viruses. The AYUSH ministry, in a letter referenced here, directed states and union territories to start commercial production of the herbal formulation claiming that it enhances immunity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing the nation on lockdown, had recommended the use of alternative medicine as suggested by the AYUSH ministry to boost immunity.

Nonetheless, conventional medicine has not recognized the value of such formulations, citing lack of research studies.

### Protocol and treatment approach:
**AYUSH KWATH is a combination of four medicinal herbs commonly used in every Indian kitchen - basil leaves (tulsi), cinnamon bark (dalchini), Zingiber officinale (sunthi), and krishna marich (Piper nigrum).**

**Mix 3 g of the Churnam in 150 ml of freshly boiled water. Let it remain for 5 minutes. Strain and take once or twice daily. Jaggery / lemon juice can be added for flavour. This is the recommended dosage for adults only. Drink 1-2 cups of the tea daily.**

### Typical duration of treatment:
Can be consumed regularly, like herbal teas.

### Outcome:
Based on the traditional understanding of the properties of these herbs, it is expected that the immune-modulatory, antiviral, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet, anti-atherosclerotic, hepato-protective, reno-protective properties of the herbs in the preparation would be safe and effective in immuno-regulation for controlling viral infections like COVID-19.

### Significant side effects:
This is a traditional treatment with no known side effects.

### Recommended quantity for stocking:
**VACANT**

### Price:
INR 150 for one bottle.

### Suggested suppliers:
"Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala and other trusted stores selling herbal medicine

The formulation may be manufactured and sold in generic name as ‚ÄòAyush Kwath‚Äô or ‚ÄòAyush Kudineer‚Äô or ‚ÄòAyush Joshanda‚Äô.

## 6. Dr. Swapna Reddy's (MD (Ayurveda)) clinically proven treatment protocol		

### Objective: 
The treatment of mild or even very severe Covid-19 infections in very short durations

### System:
Ayurveda and Panchakarma therapy

### Can be used alongside other allopathic treatments:
Recommended to be used exclusively, not alongside allopathic treatments

### Status of authorisation:
Dr. Swapna Reddy established the [Siddha Nagarjuna Ayurveda Clinic][80] in Hyderabad and has been practising Ayurveda for 19-20 years.

The treatment is reported to have been effectively used to mitigate even infections in the last and critical stages, and proven clinically with over 300 patients including the doctor's own father and critically ill mother in Dr. Swapna Reddy's Ayurveda and Panchakarma clinic in Hyderabad. Dr. Reddy is an academically accomplished gold medallist in MD (Ayurveda) from Gujarat Ayurved University, specialized in Ayurvedic pharmacology and the treatment of end-stage illnesses through Panchakarma therapy in Ayurveda, and a certified Isha Hatha Yoga Teacher.

Over 300 patients have recovered from Covid-19 through Dr. Swapna Reddy's care, and have no side effects from the treatment. A few have acknowledged the efficacy of the cures in social media video testimonies. Among these, there were patients whose conditions were so critical that the doctor believes that they are unlikely to have survived through Standard Of Care therapy, as they may not have been able to withstand potent drugs.

### Protocol and treatment approach:
**Dr. Swapna Reddy's Ayurvedic preventive therapy for Covid-19:**

**Ayurveda has a three-pronged approach to prevention and cure, namely, Aahaaram (Food), Vihaaram (Lifestyle) and Oushadham (Medicine).** 

In **Aahaaram or diet**, it is important to eat freshly cooked and natural foods, and minimize foods that aggravate Kapha dosha, especially if the body is resistng an infection. When one is healthy, one can eat all fresh fruits and vegetables and freshly cooked food. Dairy products too can be consumed. It is important to consume foods that are rich in Praana or life energy, life-giving foods. (Here's, for quick reference, [a list of some Positive, Negative and Neutral Praanic foods, according to Ayurveda][81]. It is said that winter or ash gourd, or white pumpkin, is a food with the highest Praanic quality, and its juice drunk on an empty stomach in the morning is extremely vitalizing for the body.)

However, as soon as there are symptoms of Kapha (mucous), such as a runny nose or cough or mucal congestion in the chest, it is important to stop consuming all foods that aggravate Kapha, including fruits, raw vegetables and all dairy products. Here is [a brief description of the Kapha Dosha (Kapha imbalance), according to Ayurveda, and its dietary and lifestyle remedies.][82]

**How to mitigate Kapha dosha in the body (i.e., dietary prescription for mitigating cold, cough and other respiratory ailments):**
To reduce Kapha, avoid cold food, fruits, sweets, chocolates, refined and processed foods, milk and all dairy products, stored foods, and even sometimes, certain raw vegetables, which are all linked with aggravation of Kapha. The exceptions are turmeric milk with ginger / cardamom / black pepper. This is the Pathya or dietary regimen for Kapha mitigation in a patient with excessive Kapha, and the food for another individual physiological Prakrti may be different from that prescribed for a patient with Kapha imbalance. A good thumb rule with respect to diet may be [to know the effect of a food on Kapha by observing the effect of consuming it on the body.][83]

It is beneficial to add the following Oushadha or medicinal herbs and spices to the diet as Kashayas or herbal decoctions:
Turmeric, Cinnamon, Cardamon, Dry ginger powder (Sonti / Chukku), Black pepper, Tulasi / Holy basil, Pippali / Indian long pepper

With respect to **Vihaaram or lifestyle**, it is important not to be stressed, and to be religious about Yoga, Pranayama and meditation or Dhyaana. It is important to be peaceful and happy, which is the primary necessity for a healthy body and a strong immune system.

**Isha Yoga and Hatha Yoga:**
Dr. Swapna Reddy avows the great value of Isha Hatha Yoga and Simha Kriya to maintain the health of the immune system and the respiratory system. Isha Simha kriya, performed regularly 3 times a day, increases lung capacity and keeps the blood oxygen levels high. Isha kriya, performed regularly, makes the mind peaceful and stress-free and thus promotes immune health. The physician has observed with her patients that even those who have not been trained in Yoga and Pranayama would benefit adequately from regular practice of these Kriyas. **Isha Kriya** assists the mind to reduce depression and anxiety and to develop detachment in life. **Simha Kriya** helps to increase lung capacity, and is seen to increase oxygen saturation in the blood (as measured with an oxymeter) by even 5 %.

[Isha Kriya- Free Online Guided Meditation][85]
[Isha Kriya Instructions- English (PDF)][86]

[Medicinal incense or Dhoopam:][87]
Also, with respect to lifestyle or Viharam, Ayurveda recommends to purefy the living environment and discourage proliferation of pathogens by fumigating the home twice daily, in the morning and evening, with Dhoopams or incenses like **Patanjali Aastha Dasanga Powder or [Aparajitha Dhooma Choornam][88], or if these are not available, [then][89] Sambrani Dhoopam or simply fumigating by placing Neem leaves on burning coal.**

**Steam inhalation with medicinal oils:**
As a preventative measure, and especially after suspected exposure, it is recommended to use [Halin Drops][90] in steam inhalation. During steam inhalation, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, and vice versa, alternately. This remedy would help to clear the virus from the nose, mouth and respiratory tract, where it is said to reside for 4-5 days before progressing to an infection. For those who are occupationally exposed to the pathogen, it might be a good idea to inhale steam before entering the home, by installing a steamer in the front room.

**Oushadham:**
Ayurveda and Hatha yoga place great emphasis on boosting immunity. There are a great variety of immunoboosters in Ayurveda, and prominent among them are Ashwagandha, Guduchi / Giloy / Amrutha, Mahasudarsana kadha / Mahasudarsana ghana vati, Mahasudarsana choornam, Guduchi satvam, Godanti bhasma etc. When these medications are used, along with the adoption of an Ayurvedic lifestyle and yogic practices (such as Isha hatha yoga and Simha kriya), the body will not succumb to Covid-19.

**Ayurvedic medicine for prophylaxis after exposure and early treatment:**

**For prevention, procure, measure and mix together the following medications in the given proportions into one powder:**

**WARNING: This therapy should only be taken strictly under medical supervision, and are not recmomended for self-medication as overdosage of some components could lead to serious side effects. It is best avoided during pregnancy and in infants. Lactating mothers and children may follow the prescription in low doses but strictly under medical supervision.**

1. [Mahasudarshana Choornam][91] 100 g, containing **Guduchi / Tinospora cordifolia / Giloy / Amritavalli, Kiratatikta / Swertia chirata / Nilavembu / Chiretta, Musta / Cyperus rotundus / Koari kizhangu / Muttanjga / Tunge gadde / Nut or Coco or Java grass, Neem / Azadirachta indica / Veppu, Shunthi / Zingiber officinale / Chukku / Dried [ginger][92]**

2. [Guduchi / Giloy Satvam][93] 50 g

3. [Godanti Bhasmam][94] 10 g, containing **Godanti patthar / Gypsum, Ghritkumari Swaras / Aloevera juice, Nimbu / lemon**

**Take 3 g of this mixture and mix it with honey to prepare balls. Take 1.5 g or half the prepared quantity in the morning, and the remaining 1.5 g in the evening, 30 minutes before meals. Before going to bed, have Triphala Choornam.**

**Ayurvedic remedies for advanced Covid symptoms:**
Advanced Covid-19 symptoms can be treated effectively and efficiently by competent Ayurvedic physicians, but the treatment must be customized to the patient's physiology and exact symptoms. It is probably for this reason that the AYUSH Ministry has refrained from recommending therapies to treat advanced infection. The treatment of aggravated symptoms in Ayurveda makes use of metallomineral compounds that cannot be widely prescribed to the general public. Therefore it is recommended to consult with a competent nearby Ayurvedic physician in such cases.

**Antibiotics and Immunosuppressants:**
Antibiotics are inadvisable as they kill the microbiota in the human system, and thereby decrease the life force within the body. Corticosteroids, antihistamines and many other anti-inflammatory drugs act by suppressing the body's natural immunity, and like antibiotics, these carry the risk of adverse effects and leave the body vulnerable to other diseases. Thus the body is saved from the immediate crisis at the expense of the holistic health of the body.

Ayurveda, on the other hand, changes the medium of the body to make it inhospitable for pathogens, thereby suppressing the disease, while being supportive of the body's own probiotic and immune health. Therefore Ayurveda and traditional and natural medicines are always preferable to allopathic therapies, which should be used only as a last resort.

**Background on the treatment approach adopted in the Ayurvedic sciences:**
Dr. Swapna Reddy affirms that there are a very large number of cures in Ayurveda fro Covid, because Ayurveda is a holistic science that seeks to address the particular deficiencies or Dosha imbalance of the individual patient through a customized treatment protocol, rather than address the particular pathogen that has precipitated the symptoms. Patients thus emerge stronger than they were before the treatment, as opposed to mainstream or allopathic treatment protocols, where the side effects of the treatment themselves occasionally cause death or prolonged symptoms. Covid, in generally, is observed to attack the weakest organ system of the patient, and therefore there are a wide range of herbal medications that may need to be applied on a case-by-case basis. A correctly designed treatment protocol is found, in fact, to comprehensively treat all underlying conditions of the patient in addition to the SARS-CoV-2. For example, Aswagandha treatment for stress is found to also treat Covid symptoms. There is such a wide range of potential treatment protocols that every physician who has developed their own successful therapeutic strategies for Covid is likely to be using a uniquely different approache. In reality, SARS-CoV-2 is not deemed by learned Ayurveda and traditional physicians to be a difficult infection to treat, as even with no treatment, about 90 % of patients recover, but the typical manifestation of Covid is somewhat stronger than the typical flu infection.

However there are also a general treatment protocol and diet, which are 90 % successful and explained in the instructional videos released by Dr. Reddy. There are also treatments in Ayurveda for the vaccine injuries, which are highly effective.

**Comparison of the Ayurvedic and allopathic approach to treating Covid:**
The allopathic approach relies heavily on the use of corticosteroids, antihistamines and other substances to suppress the immune system, thereby mitigating the inflammatory response that is fatal in so many vulnerable Covid-19 patients. Allopathic therapy also relies on the use of antibiotics like Doxycycline and Azithromycin for their antiviral and antibiotic effect. However these chemicals also harm the body and are not, ultimately, life-giving. Instead, they suppress the body's own healing potential, one way or another, even if the Covid is effectively cured, and this leaves the body subsequently susceptible to other diseases and afflictions.

In Ayurveda, the Nadi method of diagnosis and symptomatic diagnosis are used to decide upon the right herbal medication, which are used to change the 'medium' within the body to make it inhospitable to the virus. At the same time, the organs in the body are not affected by the changed medium,.Thus Ayurveda and allopathy work in mutually contradictory ways.

Therefore it is important that when Ayurvedic medicines are used, allopathic medications should be avoided."

### Typical duration of treatment:
The treatment has been demonstrated to yield rapid results, with even an instance of the doctor's own mother, who was severely ill and nearly unconscious with Covid-19, and who had suffered from severe underlying medical conditions, recovering rapidly and regaining appetite in a matter of a few hours.

### Outcome:
"Very good results, and rapid recovery from infection observed with the therapy, and reportedly demonstrated to be effective in curing 100 percent of over 300 cases in the physician's clinic.

Dr. Swapna Reddy also cites, from her clinical experience, that Ayurveda offers excellent methods for prevention of Covid-19."

### Significant side effects:
Dr. Reddy explains that Ayurvedic treatments inhibit viral replication in the body with increased immunity and in large part, with no adverse effects. However, some components of the present protocol, chiefly **Godanti Bhasma**, can have significant adverse effects if overdosed. Moreover, pregnant or lactating woman, infants and children may be advised not to take certain medications, or use them in a lower dosage. Therefore it is best not to self-medicate but to adopt this treatment strictly under medical supervision.

## 8. Camphor + Ajwain / Carom seeds + Lavang / Cloves + Eucalyptus oil aromatic pouch / Potli for inhalation

### Objective: 
Relief from respiratory congestion and breathing difficulty, and increase blood oxygenation

### System:
Traditional medicine, recommended also by naturopaths

### Can be used alongside other allopathic treatments:
Yes.

### Status of authorisation:
Among the remedies documented here, this remedy may be the least supported by mainstream research evidence, as there are several fact-checking articles online ""debunking the myth"", such as this article, which nonetheless admits that camphor constitutes 4.8 % of the common decongestant and cough mitigant Vicks VapoRub:
[The Federal: Beware: Camphor doesn‚Äôt help improve body‚Äôs oxygen level, it can be toxic; May 5, 2021][126]

Dr. Prakash Gyawali, an Ayurvedic physician, explains that Camphor helps to open the nasal passages in case of cold while Cloves dry the phlegm, Eucalyptus oil is a nasal decongestant and Carom seeds / Ajwain are used in many Ayurvedic medicines for their expectorant and drying properties. However, he too believes that the claim that they increase oxygen saturation in blood is not well-founded in existing research:
[South Asia Check | Fact Check: A supposed home remedy for boosting blood oxygen levels is unfounded; Deepak Adhikari; April 29, 2021][127]

It has also been [reported][128] that anosmia or loss of taste and smell, one of the common and peculiar symptoms of Covid-19, especially in the first wave and earlier variants, [attributed also to vitamin D deficiency and Zinc deficiency][129], can be reversed through steam inhalation with [eucalyptus oil][130]. Ajwain has been known to have a bronchodilatory effect and be useful in the treatment of asthma:
[Bronchodilatory Effect of Carum copticum in Airways of Asthmatic Patients; Mohammad Hossein Boskabady et al.; Therapie; Jan, 2007][131]

[Anti-inflammatory activity of 1.8-cineol (eucalyptol) in bronchial asthma: a double-blind placebo-controlled trial; U R Juergens et al.; Respiratory Medicine; Mar, 2003][132]

In fact, Carom seeds (active agents, thymol oil, terpine and linonene) and Eucalyptus oil (active agents, cineole and eucalyptol) [are often prescribed][133] in traditional home remedies to combat shortness of breath, especially for those suffering from asthma, where it is recommended that the oil of Eucalyptus be added to hot water for steam inhalation or that Carom seeds be slightly roasted to release the vapours that are sniffed to dilate the bronchial passages.

In this video, the well-known Ayurveda and Yoga physician and spiritual teacher [Dr. Balaji Tambe][134], prescribes the [Camphor + Ajwain + Abhyang oil Potli][135] for those suffering from hypoxia and breathing difficulty, and mentions the customary use of this breathing aid by unaccustomed travellers to higher altitudes like Amarnath or Badrinath or Ladakh in the Himalayas. **Acharya Tambe recommended that the chest be massaged with the Ayurvedic medicated oil Abhyang before the inhalation of vapours from the Ajwain-Camphor Potli, containing mostly Ajwain and only a pinch of pure camphor.** It should be noted that the camphor used should prefefrably be [natural camphor (obtained from a tree bark)][136] very pure and is the more expensive, expensive variety, which is not toxic even if ingested in very small quantities [(whereas synthetic camphor is inexpensive, and manufactured from oil of turpentine)][137]:
[Shreeguru Dr. Balaji Tambe: Camphor-Ajwain for Breath; 2020][138]

There is also much [anecdotal evidence from clinicians][139] and patients who have used the technique to mitigate breathing difficulty in Covid-19 patients. [Ayurvedic Breathe Easy Potli][140] is a commercial product that uses this technique to alleviate cough, respiratory distress and improve overall respiratory health and immunity.

### Protocol and treatment approach:
A pinch of camphor, a spoon of Ajwain / Carom seeds (perhaps roasted to release more vapours), Lavang / Clove, a few drops of Eucalyptus oil, mixed and tied together in a cotton Potli / Kizhi or small pouch, and sniffed in 10-15 deep breaths every 1-2 hours. This treatment can be preceded by a topical massage of the chest with Ayurvedic Abhyang oil.

### Typical duration of treatment:
About 24 hours

### Outcome:
Patients who have used the Potli therapy report immediate symptomatic relief.

### Significant side effects:
None known. Camphor, even the natural variety, is known to be toxic if ingested in large quantities. All therapeutic medicines can be toxic if consumed in immoderate amounts.

### Recommended quantity for stocking:
Household supplies, 1-2 packets of pure natural Camphor and about 200g Ajwain.

### Price:
Ordinary household commodities could be used to make this home remedy.

### Suggested suppliers:
Local grocery or supermarket

### Further references:                          
A great deal of anecdotal evidence from clinicians, such as [cardiologist Dr. Shilpa Dane's video testimony][141]. For example, "Sharing an Incident that happened with Mr. Pramod Malkan. His daughter-in-law was tested positive for Covid and oxygen level went down to 80-85 and immediate hospitalization was recommended. Being skeptical abt the treatments at hospitals, Mr. Pramod decided to use a home remedy instead. He mixed a cube of camphor with a spoon of carom seeds and tied it in a piece of cotton cloth. He then made her smell it 10-15 times with deep breaths and repeat the same action every two hours. Within 24 hrs her oxygen level went to 98-99 without any hospitalization. After this, he helped one of his friends who was hospitalized for covid with the same remedy and as a result, his friend was released from the hospital. Carom seeds is - ajwain ‡§Ö‡§ú‡§µ‡§æ‡§á‡§® (‡§ì‡§µ‡§æ)"

## 9. Haldi-30 Therapy, using a "superactive extract" of Haldi / Turmeric in Sesame oil		

### Objective: 
The mitigation of Covid-19 in mild, moderate and advanced stages of the disease

### System:
Ayurveda, Integrative medicine

### Can be used alongside other allopathic treatments:
**VACANT**

### Status of authorisation:
**The following webpage documents the journey of the therapy, developed through the innovations of Dr. S. G. Kane and Vaidya Sarang Phadke and being used effectively in the Vaidya's clinic for over 16 years.**
[Haldi-30 Ayurvedic Superactive Extract][143]

**Excerpt from the page:**
The basic methodology for producing such an extremely bioactive extract of any herb was invented by Dr. S.G Kane, a chemical engineer and scientist who holds the worldwide process patent. Dr. Kane has invented this process for making extracts from any Ayurvedic herb, which results in creation of herb nano-particles in a low dose formulation that work at a deep cellular level. The further brainstorming and idea to use Turmeric super-active extract specifically for the coronavirus was Vaidya Sarang Phadke's own contribution, as was the specific dosage requirement in case of Covid-19. Vaidya Phadke came upon the dosage requirement ‚Äì up to 5 times in a day ‚Äì after researching several scientific studies which showed that frequent dosing is needed as Turmeric levels rapidly clear the bloodstream. Turmeric doesn‚Äôt work as effectively in any other form, but it works extremely well in this extract form because of the presence of bioactive nano-particles.

**In Dr. Dravid's words:**
**"I have made multiple attempts to reach out to the Central Government, mainly through the Ministry of Ayush, beginning first on August 15, 2020; I sent them a follow up reminder on the 20th of September. However, after receiving no response from Ayush, I made a complaint with the Prime Minister‚Äôs Grievance Cell, who did respond and forwarded my communication to Ayush, advising them to look into the matter.**

**Ayush sent my written clinical findings and data to the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences to validate my claims. CCRAS further requested me to submit 45 case reports and I attended meetings with them over the course of two months. However, they later objected saying that after the patient recovery, I failed to have a repeat RTPCR test done proving the patients were negative. And so, they informed me, my claim was denied. This happened around January-February when the incidence of cases had declined, and so I didn‚Äôt bother further with the Ministry. But soon, March onward there was a sudden spike in cases again, and I sometimes would see as many as 15 Covid patients in a day. Again, I wrote back again to CCRAS, along with negative repeat test reports of the first 3 patients I had treated. I am also following up further with more cases with negative RTPCR test reports upon their recovery from my treatment.**

**If the Government decides to accept these finding as valid, the true advantage to this extract medicine is that it is proven safe and non-toxic, both by empirical use in our country over generations as food, as well as in my own 16 years of clinical practice. Among the 200 patients treated by me, only two had mild side-effects of oral ulcers, which were immediately managed with additional Ayurvedic medicines. These patients were able to complete their course of treatment with no further issues. Across all ages from young children to the elderly this medicine is very safe.**

**If this medicine were to be used on a mass scale, because we are seeing a tremendous spike in cases at present India, it would be of great benefit. Every single case I have treated was managed effectively at the upper respiratory tract level, without ever getting worse and entering the lungs and without needing hospitalization.Indeed, this approach would reduce the current heavy burden on our hospitals and assuredly reduce the number of severe cases progressing to deaths.**

**There are some pharmaceutical medicines now being used which have worked well such as Fabilu (Favipiravir), but they are very expensive, and produce side-effects as well;  instead of depending on such drugs, if Haldi-30 were to be widely used, it would not only be very cost effective, it would also improve the health outcomes on a mass level. Further, it would allay the extremely horrifying situation we are facing now.**

This medicine is easy to use, but as covid is a serious illness, I administer it to patients under my direct supervision, and monitor them closely on a daily basis over the phone while they are under treatment. I am cautious when monitoring patients, that if there is any change in symptoms, I order a chest X-ray to ensure that the infection hasn‚Äôt entered the lungs.

Now there is a limit to how many cases I can manage myself alone. Although I may have researched and tested and verified the efficacy of this medicine, I have no desire or expectations of any monetary returns or benefit. As the medicine is very cost-effective, if the Government so decides, it could be made widely available to the public."

### Protocol and treatment approach:
**Excerpt from an interview given by Vaidya Sarang Phadke in April, 2021:**
"I have observed that symptomatic patients respond to this medicine within the first 3-4 days, and usually 30% of patients become fully asymptomatic with just a single dose or within two or three days. Patients with Diabetes or other co-morbidities, become symptom-free in 7-8 days. However, I do have my patients continue to take the medicine for the full 14 day quarantine period. So far, I have treated close to 200 Covid-19 patients, ranging in age from a 1 year 10 month old baby girl to an elderly gentleman of 88. This medicine has been effective in 100% of all patients, who have recovered fully."

### Typical duration of treatment:
**Excerpt from an [interview given by Vaidya Sarang Phadke][145] in April, 2021:**
"I have observed that symptomatic patients respond to this medicine within the first 3-4 days, and usually 30% of patients become fully asymptomatic with just a single dose or within two or three days. Patients with Diabetes or other co-morbidities, become symptom-free in 7-8 days. However, I do have my patients continue to take the medicine for the full 14 day quarantine period."

### Outcome:
**Excerpt from an [interview given by Vaidya Sarang Phadke][146] in April, 2021:**
"I have observed that symptomatic patients respond to this medicine within the first 3-4 days, and usually 30% of patients become fully asymptomatic with just a single dose or within two or three days. Patients with Diabetes or other co-morbidities, become symptom-free in 7-8 days. However, I do have my patients continue to take the medicine for the full 14 day quarantine period. So far, I have treated close to 200 Covid-19 patients, ranging in age from a 1 year 10 month old baby girl to an elderly gentleman of 88. This medicine has been effective in 100% of all patients, who have recovered fully."

**Adds Dr. Vikram Dravid, who is championing the novel treatment:**
**"I personally have used this methodology in creating diverse formulae to treat various conditions, including treatment failures of modern medicine. This type of medicine works faster, at a lower dose than conventional Ayurvedic medicines, and with great ease of use for the patient.**

**The great advantage to using Haldi-30 as a first-line treatment strategy is the extreme potency, which helps conserve natural herb resources amidst overwhelming demand during a pandemic."**

### Significant side effects:
As both Turmeric and Sesame oil are edible food substances, this extract is non-toxic and proven to be safe, and Vaidya Dr. Sarang Phadke reports that they have been using it as an ingredient in various formulations in clinical practice for 16 years now.

### Recommended quantity for stocking:
**VACANT**

### Price:
**Says Vaidya Dr. Sarang Phadke:**

"There are some pharmaceutical medicines now being used which have worked well such as Fabilu (Favipiravir), but they are very expensive, and produce side-effects as well.  **Instead of depending on such drugs, if Haldi-30 were to be widely used, it would not only be very cost effective, it would also improve the health outcomes on a mass level.** Further, it would allay the extremely horrifying situation we are facing now."
