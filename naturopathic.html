The experimental inoculations are speeding up the evolution of newer aggressive variants. <strong>The primary line of prophylaxis must be the natural human immunity</strong>.

There is substantial evidence supporting the efficacy of several vitamins, minerals and other nutrients to prevent and mitigate Covid-19. These include <strong>vitamins D, C, and A, Zinc, Quercetin, Glutathione and N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC)</strong>.

Vitamin C kills viruses, D builds immunity, and Zinc inhibits viral replication in cells. <strong>Zn is difficult to transport into cells and needs a Zinc ionophore like Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)</strong>, which was banned by policymakers in many Western regional administrations shortly after it was reported that HCQ would be an antidote to Covid-19. <strong>The antioxidant quercetin has been shown to be a zinc ionophore</strong>, published in a 2014 NIH study. Incidentally, <strong>green tea and dark chocolate are rich in flavonols like Quercetin</strong>.</p> <p>Studies have conclusively showed a strong correlation of degree of vitamin D deficiency and severity of Covid. <strong>Glutathione</strong>, which is an antoxidant manufactured in the body with plant foods, is another vital nutrient that kills infections. Glutathione opens up respiratory passageways and increases blood oxygen saturation. <strong>N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)</strong> is another vital and healing nutrient that converts in the body into the antoxidant Glutathione. In patients with pneumonia, the NAC thins out phlegm in the lungs so that it can be expectorated out.</p> <p>It is important to recognize that these healing nutrients need to be administered in optimal, therapeutic doses for their maximum benefits and minimal adverse effect. It is not widely appreciated that exposure to a pathogen does not necessarily lead to infection, and healthy immune systems are, in the vast majority of cases, able to deal with pathogens without succumbing to illness.</p> <p>There are other products that have been proven to be very effective at &quot;stopping the bandit at the door&quot;, so to speak, such as disinfectant mouthwash and nasal spray. <strong>Chlorhexadine</strong> has been shown to kill 99 % of the Covid virus in a sample.</p> <p>There is substantial research showing that Covid-susceptible people are deficient in Bifidobacterium in their GI tract, often due to antibiotic use, making them susceptible to viral diseases. Dr. Ealy has never needed pharmaceutical drugs in his 20+ years in clinical practice, and therefore is not able to comment on the need for pharmaceutical medication like Ivermectin or HCQ. However there is much respect for the work of admirable physicians like Dr. Pierre Kory and Dr. Joseph Mercola. A notable exception, during the present pandemic, was the instance of one critically ill patient who developed pneumonia on the third day of infection and was refused conventional healthcare. He recovered under Dr. Ealy's care in just 8 days, with an IV infusion of the therapeutic nutrient cocktail called Myers' Cocktail, a liquid glutathione drip, Bifidobacteria, Ivermectin and Prednisone. Ivermectin helps in the same way that Bifidobacteria do. However, there is thus no &quot;&quot;magic bullet&quot;&quot; for this disease. It is important to explain to patients what is being done and why, and that they will recover soon and regain lifelong immunity,so that they are reassured about the course and predicted outcome of the treatment, thereby engaging their parasympathetic nervous system and relieving them of the stress and anxiety that are so correlated with poor treatment outcomes.</p> <p>Risk stratification is an important component of the therapeutic approach. As 99.57 % of those under 65 and exposed to the virus recover and 99.98 % of those under 39, the mandating of 6 feet social distancing and masking everywhere appear to be an overkill. The disease is not a serious concern for younger people. However &gt; 99 % Americans are deficient in vitamin D. Therefore the current Covid response policy does not appear to be informed by science and by empirical observations.</p> <p>Dr. Ealy's team have published a report on the most beneficial nutritional therapy for Covid, based on available evidence, which were identified to include vitamins D, C, A and <strong>E, L-arginine and Phosphatidylcholine</strong>, amoung others. Of these, <strong>L-arginine is found in protein-rich foods, including beans</strong>, and <strong>Phosphatidylcholine is found in eggs and whole grains. Food sources are the best way to obtain these nutrients. The best prophylactics, according to their research, are nutrients, nutrients and nutrients</strong>. These nutrients are also effective at healing the damage caused by the toxic spike glycoproteins, due to infection or inoculation. <strong>L-arginine</strong> converts in the body into nitric oxide, which dilates blood vessels and limits damage. <strong>Phosphatidylcholine</strong> helps to heal damage to the inside of vascular walls from spike proteins, causing inflammatory damage like myocarditis and pericarditis.</p> <p><strong>It would be good to take a good multivitamin supplement containing especially the water-soluble vitamins B-complex and C, as they are quickly excreted and difficult to get in sufficient quantities through food. The B-complex vitamins are needed for cellular energy production, for the production of ATP molecules for cellular enzyme production, for healing, repair and metabolism at the cellular level. A thumbrule to identify a good multivitamin supplement is to look for one that contains Pantothenic Acid or B5 in quantities greater than 100 mg. Ideally, the amount of B5 should exceed 200 mg, and then the rest of the formulation probably contains all the other nutrients in therapeutic range as well. Onions, capers and blueberry smoothies probably contain Quercetin in therapeutic amounts. Organic carrot juice is a good source of Betacarotene. Vitamin D can be obtained in therapeutic amounts from sunlight, and Zinc in therapeutic amounts from pumpkin seeds.</strong></p> <p>The most common symptom among all (99.99 %) pathologies is fatigue. Thus energy production is vital for the immune system. There is published research showing that proton pump inhibitors, used by many as antacids, turn off or decouple innate healing mechanisms, lysosomal activity in cells, which involve digestive enzymes that kill infections. Hence it is important to stop using proton pump inhibitors as antacids.</p> <p>The following are the most important recommendations for doctors:</p> <ol><li>First check vitamin D levels and get them above 55 ng/mL, which virtually guarantees recovery.</li> <li>If the patient has been on antibiotics, start them on the probiotic Bifidobacterium.</li> <li>Educate patients about health.</li></ol> <p>The following are the essential components and practices for a healthy life:</p> <ol><li>A positive outlook on life. Turn off the TV, the phone and get outside! Riding a bike, meditation, Praanayaama, Tai Chi, Qigong, Yoga, walking with someone we love and holding their hands releases oxytocin. Hug family members and tell them we love them.</li> <li>Getting sunlight, and the darker the eye colour, the longer the time that needs to be spent in the sun.</li> <li>Sleep 8 hours a night. Take a bath before bed and think of some positive things that happened during the day. Burn lavender oil. Such positive and affirmative practices engage the parasympathetic (&quot;Rest &amp; Digest&quot;) nervous system that is so vital for healing.&quot;</li></ol> <h3 id="typical-duration-of-treatment"><a href="#typical-duration-of-treatment" class="header-anchor">#</a> Typical duration of treatment:</h3> <p>Recovery was found to be dramatically quickened, and a critical patient with a very aggressive case of Covid-19 in the advanced pulmonary phase recovered with strong nutritional therapy and mild therapy using integrative medicine in just 8 days.</p> <h3 id="outcome"><a href="#outcome" class="header-anchor">#</a> Outcome:</h3> <p>Dr. Ealy has treated many patients with Covid symptoms in his clinic using nutritional therapy alone, and his findings and integrative treatment protocol are highly evidence-based.

They requested US State Health Departments to give nutritional guidelines to patients and the general public as the first step to mitigating the pandemic. Though many attorneys expressed interest in the information and were educated by the team, there was no other positive outcome from the campaign.</p> <h3 id="significant-side-effects"><a href="#significant-side-effects" class="header-anchor">#</a> Significant side effects:</h3> <p>No adverse side effects are reported when the prescribed nutrients are used in therapeutic dosages in the long term.

Lunch could consist of a simple meal with organic raw rice and vegetables and a generous amount of uncooked salad. Dinner should preferably be very early in the evening, or before sundown, to permit at least 15-16 hours of fasting before the next meal. It is very important to retire early, between 9 - 10 PM.</p> <p>The primary approach to treating early symptoms is <strong>to adopt a complete water fast for 3-4 days</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Method of treatment of breathlessness</strong>:
In addition to the prone position, there are other methods of treating breathlessness. One of them is to use the Camphor-Ajwain-Lavang pouch for smelling to reduce breathlessness. With children, the pouch can be hung around the neck. Also drink hot water. Heat the chest with fomentation or a hot water bag or a hot salt pouch for men, and back for women. Compulsorily wash the head and place a wet cloth on the head, with the patient seated on a stool, when there is breathlessness. Also, immerse the feet in a bucket or tub of hot water, with the temperature of the water being as high as the patient can tolerate, and perform this treatment for about half an hour. In this physician's experience, breathlessness is not a particularly common symptom of Covid.</p> <p>Completely avoid processed and artificial foods, while eating a wholesome, natural and seasonal diet.</p> <p><strong>Completely avoid paracetamol for suppressing Covid symptoms.</strong></p> <p>Drink a decoction of Chukku or Saunth or dried ginger, fresh ginger, pepper, crushed and boiled in water, for a traditional cure.</p> <p>Drink plenty of water, sipping it a little by little, throughout the day, and urinate.</p> <p>At start of symptoms, take enema to cleanse the bowel.</p> <p>Take complete rest, after covering the body in a bedsheet.</p> <p>Fever higher than 106 degree Celsius indicates a malfunctioning hypothalamus-regulated mechanism to control temperature and can be dangerous. The body should be cooled with ice or wet compresses to reduce core temperature, or usnig a very cold enema.</p> <p>After fever subsides, drink citrus juices for a few more days. Afterwards, begin the road to normalcy through raw diet, especially of fruits as appetite returns, and slowly reintroduce cooked food.</p> <p>If any meals are had during the course of treatment, have 1-2 flakes of raw garlic dipped in Inthuppu or rock salt or potassium chloride.</p> <p>Very important not to fear Covid, and feel stressed.</p> <h3 id="typical-duration-of-treatment-3"><a href="#typical-duration-of-treatment-3" class="header-anchor">#</a> Typical duration of treatment:</h3> <p>Perhaps about 1-2 weeks, in most cases.</p> <h3 id="outcome-3"><a href="#outcome-3" class="header-anchor">#</a> Outcome:</h3> <p>A reported zero fatality rate and good prognosis.</p> <h3 id="significant-side-effects-3"><a href="#significant-side-effects-3" class="header-anchor">#</a> Significant side effects:</h3> <p>Overall betterment of whole body wellness, no significant adverse side effects likely.

The DIP Diet Plan is as follows:</p> <p><strong><ins>Breakfast:</ins></strong><br> <strong>Eat only fruits till 12 noon. 3-4 types of seasonal fruits, like banana, grapes, papaya, orange etc.</strong> can be chosen.
Minimum quantity of fruits to be consumed =
[(Number of kilograms in body weight) X 10] in grams
For example, if body weight = W kg, then W X 10 grams of fruits should be consumed before 12 noon as breakfast.</p> <p><strong><ins>Lunch and Dinner:</ins></strong><br>
Lunch and dinner should each consist of two plates.
<strong>Plate 1 should consist of 3-4 types of raw vegetables like cucumber, tomatoes, capsicum, cauliflower, carrot, spinach etc. The quantity consumed must be as many grams as is equal to 5 times body weight (expressed in kilograms)</strong>. For example, a person weighing 70 kg should consume 70 x 5 = 350 grams of raw vegetables on Plate 1, both for lunch and for dinner.
<strong>Plate 2</strong> can consist of a traditional wholly plant-based or wholly vegan meal, with negligible oil and salt.</p> <p><strong>Plate 1 should be finished first before commencing Plate 2. One can eat as much as one likes from Plate 2.</strong>
Dinner should be finished by 7 PM.</p> <p><strong><ins>Snacking:</ins></strong><br> <strong>Between lunch and dinner, fruit juice, sprouts, dry fruits (only after soaking at least 4-5 hours in water), herbal tea, green leaves or coconut water can be consumed as snacks</strong> to ward off hunger. The quantity consumed must not exceed as many grams as kilograms in body weight. For example, a person weighing 70 kilograms should not consume more than 70 grams of such snacks.</p> <p><strong>Completely avoid all animal protein and unnatural foods, including the following items:</strong>
Animal proteins like eggs, meat, fish etc.
Dairy products like milk, cream, tea, coffee, ghee, butter, paneer, ice cream, rusk etc.
Refined and packaged foods like refined flours and preparations containing them like cakes and biscuits, refined oils, fast foods like pizzas and burgers, cool drinks, refined salt like iodized table salt and refined sugars, and foods containing them.</p> <h3 id="typical-duration-of-treatment-4"><a href="#typical-duration-of-treatment-4" class="header-anchor">#</a> Typical duration of treatment:</h3> <p>A healthy recovery and maintenance diet for patients with diabetes mellitus.</p> <h3 id="outcome-4"><a href="#outcome-4" class="header-anchor">#</a> Outcome:</h3> <p>According to Dr. BRC's research publications on the DIP Diet, after following the DIP Diet for 72 hours, it is reported that the following outcomes were observed among a group of 55 patients:</p> <ul><li>57 % of type-1 diabetes patients eliminated insulin dependency and achieved a controlled blood glucose level*.</li> <li>100 % of type-2 diabetes patients were able to regain a healthy blood sugar level without medication.</li> <li>52 % of patients could free themselves of dependency on many kinds of medications, including those for B.P., cholesterol and acidity.</li> <li>Patients also experienced an average weight loss of 1.14 kg.</li></ul> <p>Here, a controlled blood glucose level denoted a blood glucose range of &lt; or = 250 mg / dl without medication and / or insulin requirement, along with the prescribed diet. In the people who achieved such a healthier condition, the diet al.one balanced the blood glucose levels, leading to zero requirement of diabetes medication or insulin.</p> <p>The study, <em>&quot;Diabetes Reversal by Plant-Based Diet&quot;</em>, cited in the references, conducted on 55 diabetes patients, interestingly, showed better efficacy of the diet with older patients with chronic type-2 diabetes. In follow-ups, those who maintained the diet and were still insulin-dependent were able to gradually reduce their dependency, and those who maintained the diet reported sustained benefits from the regimen.</p> <h3 id="significant-side-effects-4"><a href="#significant-side-effects-4" class="header-anchor">#</a> Significant side effects:</h3> <p>It has been observed that sometimes patients experience loose motion or diarrhoea while following the Three Step Flu Diet. If this happens more than 6-7 times, the patient should completely stop the fruits and salad in the DIP Diet, and consume only coconut water until the loose motion stops.</p> <p>Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease are advised to adapt the diet to their requirements, as many fruits and vegetables contain relatively high amounts of potassium, oxalates etc. that may not be compatible with a renal diet.</p> <h3 id="recommended-quantity-for-stocking-4"><a href="#recommended-quantity-for-stocking-4" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recommended quantity for stocking:</h3> <p>The diet uses everyday fruits and vegetables that need not be stocked.</p> <h3 id="price-4"><a href="#price-4" class="header-anchor">#</a> Price:</h3> <p>Everyday food items, moderately priced.</p> <h3 id="suggested-suppliers-4"><a href="#suggested-suppliers-4" class="header-anchor">#</a> Suggested suppliers:</h3> <p>Fruits and vegetables for the diet are best sourced from local stores supplying organic food.</p> <h3 id="further-references-4"><a href="#further-references-4" class="header-anchor">#</a> Further references:</h3> <ul><li><a href="https://dipdiet.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is the DIP Diet?<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></li> <li><a href="https://dipdiet.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Diabetes-Reversal-by-Plant-Based-Diet_Dr.-Biswaroop.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diabetes Reversal by Plant-Based Diet; Journal of Metabolic Syndrome, 2017; Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury, Medical nutritionist, Indo-Vietnam Medical Board<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AYP0AOcTsRM_rbxIVfw5wwMyywq6hPYS/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alternate URL<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>)</li> <li><a href="https://dipdiet.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JETIR1905867_Reduction-in-drug-dosage_Dr.BiswaroopRoyChowdhury.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reduction in Drugs Dosage: An Insight from Three Days App Based Dietary Intervention; JETIR, 2019; Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury, Dynamic Memory Pvt.

Protocol for Covid-19:</ins></strong></p> <p><strong><ins>Step One:</ins> Promoting mucosal immunity with prophylactic vitamin C via diet.</strong><br>
The body has three kinds of immunity to external pathogens- mucosal immunity, background or cellular immunity and herd immunity.</p> <p>According to a study published in Cell, <strong>40 - 60 % of the populace already had cellular background immunity to Covid-19</strong> even from the time that the novel coronavirus emerged, due to previous infections of this family of viruses. If 60 - 70 % of a population already has a degree of immunity to the virus, then the population could be said to possess a measure of <strong>herd immunity</strong> to the novel coronavirus and its variants.</p> <p>A third type of external immunity is from the mucus, or Chipchipa Padaarth, as it is known in Ayurveda, which lines the internal walls of the body. <strong>Mucosal immunity is first barrier that a virus encounters upon entering the body.</strong> If one strengthens the mucosal immunity, the virus cannot penetrate and harm the body. <strong>This can be done by consuming 0.2 g vitamin C daily, and by minimizing or avoiding all animal protein (dairy, eggs, fish and meat) and pharmaceutical medication.</strong> The vitamin C should not be ingested in tablet form but through fruits and vegetables, because any tablet- which is ingested directly into the stomach- can impair mucosal immunity.</p> <p><strong>The following food items are each sufficient to provide the necessary daily requirement of 0.2 g of vitamin C:</strong></p> <ul><li>2 mangoes,</li> <li>2 sweet limes or oranges</li> <li>1 guava</li> <li>four tomatoes</li> <li>a handful of raw peas</li> <li>300 - 400 g of different types of fruits</li></ul> <p><strong><ins>Step Two:</ins> Three-day curative diet for Influenza-Like Illnesses (ILI).</strong><br>
General protocol to be followed throughout the days of the treatment, 7-15 days, focuses on strengthening the body's own immunity, and especially the first tier of mucosal immunity:
<strong>Day 1 (Liquid diet):</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Consume citrus fruit juice and coconut water in the quantity specified below: Body weight (in kg) / 10 glasses of fresh citrus fruit juice + [Body weight (in kg)] / 10 glasses of fresh tender coconut water.</strong> Don't consume packed juice, but take fresh citrus fruit without sieving. Take citrus juice and coconut water alternately every hour, sip by sip, spending at least 15 minutes on each glass. This helps to keep temperature under control. The vitamin C in citrus fruit juice supports immunity and helps to eliminate the virus. Tender coconut water helps in hydration and is the best mineral water in the world, made by Nature.
<strong>Day 2 (Fluid diet):</strong></li> <li><strong>Consume the following foods on this day: [Body weight (in kg)] / 20 glasses of fresh citrus fruit juice + [Body weight (in kg)] / 20 glasses of fresh tender coconut water + [Body weight (in kg)] X 5 grams of cucumber and tomatoes.</strong> For example, if the body weight is 60 kg, then (60 / 20 =) 3 glasses of citrus juice and 3 glasses of fresh tender coconut water, as well as (60 X 5 =) 300 grams of cucumber and tomatoes should be consumed on Day 2. Patients may be surprised to see that by the end of Day 2, they start feeling better and their temperature is under control. They would have regained some strength.
<strong>Day 3 (Solid diet):</strong></li> <li><strong>For Breakfast, consume [Body weight (in kg)] / 30 glasses of fresh citrus fruit juice + [Body weight (in kg)] / 30 glasses of fresh tender coconut water.</strong> For example, if the body weight is 60 kg, then (60 / 3 =) 2 glasses of citrus fruit juice and 2 glasses of fresh tender coconut water should be consumed on Day 3.</li> <li><strong>For Lunch, consume [Body weight (in kg)] X 5 grams of cucumber and tomatoes.</strong> For example, if the body weight is 60 kg, then (60 X 5 =) 300 grams of cucumber and tomatoes should be consumed for lunch on Day 3.</li> <li><strong>For Dinner, if the patient has recovered and is feeling fit, they can have normal home-cooked meals prepared according to the dietary principles of naturopathy or the DIP diet, described earlier in this sheet.</strong> With this simple diet, most patients would be back to work on the fourth day after appearance of symptoms.</li></ul> <p><strong><ins>Step Three</ins>: Home management of dyspnoea and Emergency management of severe symptoms.</strong><br>
If the infection migrates from the upper to the lower respiratory tract, more severe symptoms such as breathlessness or dyspnoea would begin to manifest, and the oxygen saturation levels would begin to drop to 90 % or below. In such situations, the patient must be educated to not seek artificial ventilation in hospitals, which are known to be associated with a high mortality, but instead create a ventilator at home with <strong>techniques like prone ventilation and other methods. With the first sign of flu, contact the N.I.C.E. team at <a href="www.biswaroop.com/nice">www.biswaroop.com/nice</a> or +91-8587059169 for free support, guidance and treatment.</strong></p> <p>SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA human respiratory influenza virus that is quickly mutating, for which reason it is not easy to develop drug treatments to mitigate the virus or vaccine preventatives. (A University College of London, May, 2020, study discovered 198 mutations of the virus in 7500 people.) The disease is dangerous only when the lower respiratory tract is affected, leading to pneumonia, ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) or even cardiac injury. <strong>This occurs when medications like antipyretic, antibiotic, antimalarial, anti-HIV, or any other medication directly or indirectly lowers the body's immunity. Rather than the novel coronavirus being the culprit, the real contributor to the death toll is the treatment method prescribed by the WHO, with experimental drugs, and the ICMR's death reporting guidelines. Several countries, like Vietnam, that did not follow these protocols suffered negligible deaths and their doctors are simply asked the patients to take complete rest.</strong> About 10 percent of influenza is attributed to the family of four types of coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1) known to man for long, and patients usually recover within 3-7 days. SARS-CoV-2 too belongs to the family of similar coronaviruses, to which the human body often has background immunity.</p> <p><strong>Yoga and Praanayaama improve respiratory health and overall immunity, but masks achieve the opposite outcome. Masking for prolonged durations can precipitate Covid-like symptoms</strong>, like hypoxia / low oxygen saturation, increase in pulse rate and slightly elevated body temperature. Interestingly, masks and alcohol-based hand sanitizers were invented by the same individual Dr. Joseph Lister, and both these products reduce the body's natural immunity.</p> <p><strong><ins>Emergency Management of Covid symptoms</ins>, most important:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Breathing management</strong>: If the oxygen saturation is greater than or equal to 88 %, this is manageable. Oxygen therapy is shown in research not to increase a person's life expectancy, and no oxygen is better than some oxygen. The mechanical ventilator, which is the second line of intervention for hypoxia in hospitals, is commonly associated with adverse side effects like Ventilator-Associated Lung Inury (VALI), oxygen toxicity, neurological damage, Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP). <strong>A handheld or table fan held in front of the patient's nose for 5 minutes usually yields the same benefits as oxygen therapy, and without the toxicity created by inhalation of pure oxygen, especially in higher concentrations. In the minority of cases that the first hypoxia management method of using a handheld fan fails, use the Prone Ventilation method, where the patient is made to lie in a prone position (face down), with the support of pillows under the chest / abdominal-pelvic region for comfort, as required.</strong></li> <li><strong>Cough management: If there is uncontrolled cough, then immediately along with the Three-day Flu Diet, start turmeric therapy. Consume a small piece (0.5 g) of fresh, raw turmeric 3 times a day, before breakfast, lunch and dinner. If there is no relief, double the dose of raw turmeric, i.e., instead of 3 times a day, take it 6 times a day.</strong> The cough will subside in 2-3 days. Motivate the patient not to lose heart, and the cough will subside soon.</li> <li><strong>Fever management</strong>: If fever is less than or equal to 102 deg F, it is acceptable. <strong>If fever crosses 102 deg F, manage the temperature with cold compresses and cold air for 15 minutes. If the patient starts shivering, stop the treatment process. Do not panic if fever reaches 103-104 deg F, and do not use antipyretic medication, which have no proven efficacy or evidence of preventing seizures.</strong> Even if the temperature is very high, do not panic because the body has its own mechanisms fo homeostasis and will not let the temperature rise unduly high. In Dr. BRC's experience of 12 years of treating ILI, this has not happened even once. Continue to follow the Three-day Flu Diet and provide cold compress and cold air.</li> <li><strong>Vomiting management: If there is vomiting, try to make the patient comfortable and stop his eating and drinking for 4 hours. If need be, ordinary water and coconut water can be given.</strong> Vomiting is one of the healing symptoms of the body and usually need not be cause for concern.</li> <li><strong>Management of nausea and extreme weakness: Nausea and weakness are part of the body's healing process and need not cause undue concern. Take a small piece of fresh ginger 3-4 times a day, which gives strength. If the patient refuses to take the pungent ginger in raw form, crush the ginger, boil it in water, and add lemon juice and honey. This ginger decoction should be sipped slowly and gives a little energy and strength.</strong> When the fever subsides, these other symptoms will subside as well.</li> <li><strong>Diarrhoea or loose motion management</strong>: Sometimes patients experience loose motions while on the Three-day Flu Diet or the DIP Diet described earlier. <strong>If the loose motion occurs more than 6-7 times, then the citrus fruit juice in the Three-day Flu Diet should be stopped (or the fruits and salads, in the DIP Diet), and only tender coconut water should be consumed until the loose motions completely stop.</strong></li></ul> <p><strong><ins>Recommended Treatment Regimen Schedule in the second wave:</ins></strong></p> <ul><li>6:00 AM: Gargle with 3/4 teaspoonful of salt and 1/2 teaspoonful of turmeric in 1 glass of hot water. <strong>Start sunbathing (<a href="https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/can-vitamin-d-through-light-shirt-10178.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with minimal / light, preferably white-coloured attire<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>) and sungazing (no more than 20 seconds at a stretch).</strong></li> <li>6:15 AM: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3604064/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sniff one pinch each of dried ginger<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> (Chukku in Tamil, Saunth in Hindi) alternately in each nostril.</li> <li>6:25 AM: Anuloma Viloma Pranayama for 5 minutes</li> <li>6:30 AM: <strong>Kadha or Kashaaya (Ayurvedic bitter concoction): Boil 0.5 - 1 teaspoonful of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5388087/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turmeric<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> and 2 pinches of black pepper in a glass of water for 5 minutes.

Bananas may not be advisable, especially the large varieties (like the Kerala banana or Nendra pazham) that are known to be inflammatory and have a higher calorific value.  Capsicum is said to be supportive of immunity as it is high in magnesium, B6 and lycopene, improves immunity and has other health benefits. Capsicum is best consumed raw in salad, or lightly cooked. Pomegranate juice is also found to kill most Covid-19 viruses in vitro and can even be used as a gargle. Tomatoes are rich in the immune-supportive vitamin C.</li> <li>Animal protein like meat, fish and dairy products, eggs, nuts, hard lentils and other hard proteins must be completely avoided.</li> <li>Avoid oil, and especially all vegetable oils, and minimize consumption of salt. Avoid white sugar, polished rice, salt, and refined flours like maida, which would exclude all junk and many processed foods from the diet.</li> <li>During convalescence, can have watery rice gruel with thoroughly soaked / sprouted and cooked whole horsegram (preferred) or green gram lentil gravy, with black pepper, giniger and a little turmeric for seasoning.</li> <li>Consume the last main meal of the day before 7 PM, and eat nothing after 8:00 PM.</li> <li>Drink water away from meals, and preferably about 30 minutes before meals, never during or for about 2 hours ater meals. Naturopathy and traditional medicine suggest that drinking water with meals or during the major part of digestion will dilute gastric juices and diminish digestion. However there is not much mainstream research evidence to corroborate this idea.

Described in detail by reputed physician in Lagos, Nigeria, Dr. Eapen Koshy, MBBS, MS, FRCS(London), DNB, MBA, in multiple video testimonies, and it has been reported that Dr. Eapen successfully used the remedy to bring Covid mortality to zero in Nigeria during the &quot;first wave&quot; of the pandemic in 2020.Dr.Koshy has long been researching about gaining health through natural food and lifestyle and is the author of the book, &quot;Beyond Modern Medicine&quot;.</p> <h3 id="protocol-and-treatment-approach-7"><a href="#protocol-and-treatment-approach-7" class="header-anchor">#</a> Protocol and treatment approach:</h3> <p>&quot;According to Koshy, the pH balance of our body determines our health status more than any other parameter. An alkaline pH of 7.4 is the perfect balance that a human body should maintain to be free of all illnesses.&quot;</p> <p>With a healthy natural immune system, the body's immune reaction to pathogens would be optimally calibrated to inhibit the pathogen with minimal distress to itself, All natural foods are alkalizing and have an immediate effect on the body, just as caffeine does. It is best to have such vitalizing foods in the morning. <strong>According to Dr. Eapen Koshy's clinically demonstrated principles of preventative lifestyle, the secret to remaining largely free of all ailments, including Covid-19, is to maintain the body consistently in an alkaline condition through a naturally healthy and wholesome lifestyle in tune with the rhythm of nature, adequate use of the body through exercise, sunlight, fresh air, living amidst Nature and greenery, contact with the bare earth, and nourishment only through natural and whole foods. In particular, Dr. Koshy advises a specific alkalizing remedy to be consumed every morning on an empty stomach, described below:</strong></p> <p><strong>Consume the following ingredients in the given sequence on an empty stomach: 1) a small piece of fresh ginger with skin, 2) a piece of raw, washed lemon with peel, 3) a single raw garlic clove, peeled, 4) a raw gooseberry, 5) a glass of slightly warm turmeric water, sipped slowly over a duration of 10 minutes.</strong> Ginseng root and aloe vera are also highly alkalizing superfoods. Turmeric, in particular, contains relatively large amounts of zinc, which also greatly assists immune function against viral disease.</p> <p><strong>These ingredients are admittedly very pungent or spicy or sour to the taste, especially to those who lack core strength, a healthy and pH-neutral body and digestive health. However, if they are consumed in the specific sequence described above, the discomfort due to their sharp taste can be minimized, according to Dr. Eapen. Ginger, which is the most alkalizing, and is also the most pungent to the tastebuds, is consumed first raw and whole, along with its skin, which is its most alkalizing feature. Turmeric water, which has the least pungency and alkalinity can be consumed in slightly warm water last, and washes away the sharpness of the previous ingredients consumed. It is recommended to have more turmedic water if needed after half an hour, in order to feel vitalized.</strong></p> <p><strong><ins>Prescribed principles of a natural and healthy lifestyle for health:</ins></strong></p> <ol><li>The <strong>timings of food are even more important than the type of food.</strong> Awaken, bathe and have breakfast by sunrise, and around 8 AM. Have lunch around 12 PM, when the gastric juices are at their peak of function. Lunch consumed later in the afternoon can even be harmful. Dinner should be consumed by sunset.</li> <li>It is very important to <strong>consume food that is predominantly (85 %) alkalizing</strong>. If acidifying food is eaten, then alkalizing food must be eaten to offset or neutralize such food. After an acidifying meal like nonvegetarian food with commercial soft drinks like Coca Cola, the body is effectively imprisoned in a subsequent state of impaired immunity for about 12 hours.</li> <li>It is important to <strong>reduce sugar intake and exercise regularly</strong>.</li> <li>It is recommended to <strong>emphasize superfoods like gooseberries, avocado, moringa, spirulina etc. in the diet.</strong></li> <li>Try to <strong>choose a green habitat and communities should plant many trees in the environment that affect the ecosystem in a manner akin to &quot;alkalizing&quot; it by producing highly oxygenated &quot;super air&quot;.</strong> Though there has not been much research in this direction, maybe the coconut palm is such a tree, growing in abundance in southern India.</li> <li>It is very important to <strong>avoid excessive exposure to EMF radiation</strong>, such as through wifi. There are <strong>many studies that evidence the paramount importance of intercellular communication, and wifi or EMF exposure interferes with these communication pathways, accelerating the process of ageing.</strong></li> <li>The doctor observed among healty centenarians in Africa that their habits are <strong>regular and moderate</strong>. Alcohol in moderation is deemed healthy but not when consumed in immoderate amounts. Drinking a Moringa tea everyday might promote good health.</li> <li>It is advisable to <strong>consume locally growing medicinal plants</strong> like Punarnava (in Sanskrit) in south India, also called Thazhuthama in Malayalam or Boerhavia diffusa, which rejuvenate vital organs like the liver and kidneys and strengthen immunity.</li> <li>The doctor and several others have observed a Covid-like illness in the months preceding the official recognition of the outbreak. Whether or not the disease is manmade, <strong>the only sustainable antidote to the virus is for mankind to raise their natural immunity.</strong></li> <li>It is important for the detoxification of the body to <strong>walk without footwear, in order to facilitate grounding and the passage of surcess electrons into the earth.</strong></li> <li>Milk is a white poison, and its calcium is not well absorbed by the body. <strong>Dairy products are highly acidifying and are best avoided.</strong> It is possible that the cardiovascular problems of lacto-vegetarian communities like the Brahmins are due to their consumption of milk and milk products like curd. <strong>Milk has a strong kapha-producing effect on the body.</strong></li> <li>The night and darkness are as important for the body as daylight. <strong>Artificial lighting, especially from screens, is best avoided. Sleep can be assisted by an alkalizing diet at dinnertime.</strong> For example, dinner could consist of two bitter gourds lightly cooked with a little rice. This is highly alkalizing food, and would greatly assist proper sleep at night. Another example would be about 4-5 raw ladies' fingers. Yet another suggestion is a salad consisting of finely chopped cucumbers, carrots, two varieties of fruits like pineapples and apples, and a variety of seeds like almonds or peanuts or cashew nuts, consumed before dinner. <strong>Fruits and fruit salads should be consumed before dinner to prepare the digestive ability in advance. The combined effect of these different items exceeds that of these items consumed individually. It is a mistake to use chemical sedatives to treat insomnia.</strong></li> <li><strong>Fasting is very important for health and should be compulsorily incorporated into one's life. Mahatma Gandhi's fasting was the reason for their inner strength and clarity of intellect. Intermittent fasting is very useful to maintain good health.</strong> When, after the commencement of a fast, the body feels a craving for food, is the point at which the body switches over to utilising the hormone glucagon in drawing on its own stored reserves of energy (from using energy from digested food).</li> <li><strong>In order to prevent unhealthy bloating and gas formation after food, it is important to maintain the health of the gut biota. This is achieved by having meals at the proper times, completely eschewing from all artificial chemicals, consuming healthy vegetables and alkalizing foods as prebiotics and good probiotics like Yakult, fermented foods and Kefir.</strong></li></ol> <h3 id="typical-duration-of-treatment-7"><a href="#typical-duration-of-treatment-7" class="header-anchor">#</a> Typical duration of treatment:</h3> <p>Daily regimen for prevention of all disease.</p> <h3 id="outcome-7"><a href="#outcome-7" class="header-anchor">#</a> Outcome:</h3> <p>It is said that this treatment is an excellent prophylaxis for and mitigation of Covid.</p> <h3 id="significant-side-effects-7"><a href="#significant-side-effects-7" class="header-anchor">#</a> Significant side effects:</h3> <p>No adverse effects known, improved overall health and immunity.</p> <h3 id="recommended-quantity-for-stocking-7"><a href="#recommended-quantity-for-stocking-7" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recommended quantity for stocking:</h3> <p>Everyday foods stocked for the week, 75 g ginger, one pod garlic, 7 lemons for one person each week.</p> <h3 id="price-7"><a href="#price-7" class="header-anchor">#</a> Price:</h3> <p>Commonly stocked in kitchens, no extra cost.</p> <h3 id="suggested-suppliers-7"><a href="#suggested-suppliers-7" class="header-anchor">#</a> Suggested suppliers:</h3> <p>Local grocers.</p> <h3 id="further-references-7"><a href="#further-references-7" class="header-anchor">#</a> Further references:</h3> <ul><li><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=B28O9WXS_SE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Covid-19 pandemic Q/A with Dr. Eapen Koshy | Lagos, Nigeria | Sri.

In fact, 39 had residues that were over the European Union’s maximum limits.</strong></li> <li><strong>A study on antioxidants in tea found that loose-leaf teas tend to contain more anti-inflammatory antioxidants than tea bags.</strong></li> <li><strong>The same study noted that when steeping tea, 5 minutes is long enough to extract 80–90% of its antioxidant content. A longer steeping time doesn’t extract much more.</strong></li> <li><strong>It is possible to be creative and combine different teas and other anti-inflammatory herbs, spices like cinnamon and cardamom, or even fruits like lemon or orange slices. Many of these ingredients work together to provide even more health benefits.</strong></li> <li><strong>It is also healthful to add 1-2 drops of peppermint oil, rich in Menthol, to a herbal tea, for its anticoagulant property, though those using blood-thinning drugs like Warfarin must be cautious in its use.</strong></li></ul> <p><ins>CAUTION:</ins> It is important to recognize that while they are generally nontoxic and very safe to consume, even more so than most other pharmaceutical products, these commonly used medicinal herbs may nonetheless be unsuitable for pregnant or lactating mothers, and may be likely to interact adversely with other drugs.

Of these polyphenols, Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the most potent. Green tea may help fight inflammatory conditions like Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease and certain cancers.</strong></li> <li><strong>Ginger tea: Ginger is widely known for its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, and its ability to alleviate symptoms of gastrointestinal distress by relaxing and soothing the intestinal tract. Ginger is extensively used by many traditional or indigenous systems of medicine.</strong> (Serves 1.) Boil 1 and 1/2 cups of water and simmer 6 thin slices of raw ginger in the water for 10 minutes. Switch off the burner and allow the ginger pieces to steep in the water as they cool. When the temperature has cooled to slightly above body temperature, add freshly squeezed lemon juice and raw honey or Stevia to flavour the tea. As Ayurveda recommends against heating honey, the temperature must not be too warm.</li> <li><strong>Turmeric + Pepper tea: Turmeric contains more than two dozen anti-inflammatory compounds, the most important of which is Curcumin.</strong> (Serves 4.) Boil 4 cups water. Add 1 teaspoon ground turmeric. Simmer for 10 minutes before straining into a cup and allowing to cool. Flavour with the fresh juice of 1 lemon and raw honey to taste. As Ayurveda recommends against heating honey, the temperature must not be too warm. Add a pinch of freshly ground pepper to increase the absorption of the Curcumin in the turmeric.</li> <li><strong>Tart cherry tea: Tart cherries have been shown to anti-inflammatory properties comparable to Ibuprofen and Naproxen, but without the adverse effects.</strong> (Serves 4.) Boil 3 parts, like 3/4 cup or 3 cups of water for 1-4 servings. Allow to cool a little before adding 1 part (1/4 or 1 cup, for 1 or 4 servings, respectively) of freshly prepared tart cherry juice. Allow to cool to slightly above body temperature and add the juice of 1/2 lemon and raw honey to taste.</li> <li><strong>Pineapple + Ginger + Cinnamon tea: The Bromelain in pineapple reduces chronic inflammation. Some studies concluded that this enzyme was comparable to or even more effective than NSAID painkiller drugs for managing the pain of osteoarthritis. Other studies have also found that Bromelain could be even more effective than prescription anti-inflammatory drugs for various types of pain.</strong> (Serves 2.) Place the peel of 1 Pineapple (with crown and scraps), 1 stick of good Cinnamon and 1 small piece of Ginger into a pot and cover with water. Heat on medium / low and let simmer for about 25 minutes. Turn off the burner, cover the pot with a lid and allow the infusion to steep for about 20 more minutes. Strain into a jar and drink the tea warm or refrigerate the tea if it is preferred cold.</li> <li><strong>Dandelion tea: Dandelions can detoxify the body, relieve constipation, reverse type-2 diabetes, soothe an upset stomach, help reduce water weight and help fight inflammation. Dandelion tea is made from the roots or leaves of the plant and has been used in ancient Native American and Chinese medicine for thousands of years. Studies have established that the leaves of the common dandelion plant Taraxacum officinale efficiently blocks the interaction between ACE2 cell surface recceptor and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the original virus and in many mutants.</strong> Boil water and pour the water over dried dandelion leaves. (Dandelion tea can be mildly laxative, so first-timers had better sip it at home until they adapt to the effects.)</li></ul> <p><a href="/covidcures/healthline.com/">healthline.com</a>: <strong>More ideas for antiinflammatory teas with common kitchen ingredients:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Holy basil or Tulasi tea: 'Tulasi' means “The Incomparable” and is also known as the “Queen of Herbs” due to its wide range of health-promoting properties. Tea prepared from Holy basil or Tulasi may fight inflammation and reduce pain from gout, arthritis, or other inflammatory conditions. It may also lower cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure levels. In a 4-week study in 24 healthy adults, supplementing with 300 mg of holy basil extract significantly increased levels of helper T cells and natural killer cells, both of which are immune cells that help protect and defend the body from viral infections.</strong> To brew Tulasi tea, steep a few leaves of Tulasi in boiling water for a few minutes.</li> <li><strong>Rose hip tea: Rose hips are the the coral-red, round, edible pseudo-fruits that are left after a rose bush loses its flowers. Studies show that rose hips reduce pro-inflammatory chemicals and inhibit cox-1 and 2 enzymes, which trigger inflammation and pain. They have been used as an herbal medicine for more than 2,000 years, as they have a high concentration of antioxidants, including beta carotene and vitamins C and E (14).</strong> (Serves 1-2.) To make rosehip tea, use about 10 whole, fresh or dried rose hips and mash or crumble them. Mix them with about 1 1/2 cups (355 ml) of very hot (not boiling) water and let them steep for 6–8 minutes. Strain the drink to remove the solids and add honey if desired, after the misture has cooled sufficiently. Rosehip tea has a deep red-coral color and floral notes.</li> <li><strong>Fennel tea: This liquorice-flavoured common spice is full of anti-inflammatory phenolic compounds. Some of the most active ones are Caffeoylquinic acid, Rosmarinic acid, Quercetin, and Kaempferol. Some research indicates that Fennel may reduce pain, especially menstruation-related pain, which may be due to its powerful anti-inflammatory compounds.</strong> (Serves 1.) To prepare fennel tea, pour 1 cup (240 ml) of boiling water over 2 teaspoons of crushed fennel seeds and let them steep for about 10 minutes.</li></ul> <p><strong>&quot;Covid Tea&quot;, from the <a href="lifestyle.inquirer.net">lifestyle.inquirer.net</a>: Shared by Dr. Christine Gonzalez, who is one of the many who are fighting COVID-19 from the front lines.</strong> <strong>Turmeric + Ginger + Garlic + Calamansi (also called Calamondin or Philippine lime) tea: This drink rebuilds immunity and is the best anti-inflammatory remedy. It is proven effective for cough, cold, fever, flu-like symptoms, sore throat, etc.</strong>
Wash 25 pcs small or 13 pcs large fresh organic turmeric root, 3 inches ginger root, 1 bulb garlic (preferably native), peeled and crushed, 25 pcs calamansi or two organic lemons, juiced.

Cover and infuse / steep for 15 minutes. Let it cool. Take 1 cup, three times a day if possible.</p> <p><strong>Other medicinal teas that are likely to help promote immunity while prophylaxing against Covid-19:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Richly spiced Indian immunity-building tea, recommended by fitness-conscious celebrities: Turmeric contains a compound called curcumin, which is credited for most of the potent health benefits of this yellow spice. Curcumin has anti-inflammatory properties that can help to boost immunity. Studies suggest that black pepper can inhibit the growth of several bacteria. Its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-bacterial can lower down body temperature and boost the immune system. Tulasi is rich in Vitamin C and zinc, both the nutrient acts as an immunity booster and keeps infections at bay. Tulsi leaves extract increases the Helper-T cells and natural killer cells activity, which can help to boost the immune health.The aromatic spice Cinnamon is a rich source of antioxidants like polyphenols and proanthocyanidins. It is also known for its antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal properties that help reduce the chances of infections.

Charaka, the ancient sage of Ayurveda, wrote over 500 years ago that “nothing is so troublesome as ama caused by the improper intake of honey.”)</li> <li><strong>Liquorice root tea: Licorice (Mulethi / Yashtimadhu / Atimadhuram / Irattimadhuram) root tea is commonly used as a gastrointestinal (stomach-related) remedy and to soothe a sore throat. Recent studies have suggested that licorice root is useful in treating liver disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS ) infections, and is also helpful in treating gum disease and preventing cavities. Both Ayurveda and Chinese traditional medicine have long known and valued the medicinal properties of Liquorice.</strong>
(Serves 1.) To make licorice root tea, boil 1 cup of water and pour over one licorice root. Allow Licorice root to steep for 5 minutes. Strain and serve.</li> <li><strong>American Ginseng root tea: American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius, different from Korean red ginseng or Panax ginseng) is a root used in herbal medicine. Both Native American healers and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have utilized it. Research suggests it may boost energy, stimulate the immune system, and lower blood sugars. American ginseng may offer protection against viral respiratory tract infections, including influenza, flu-like illnesses, and the common cold, according to a 2017 review. (Ashwagandha, Withania somnifera, is often called the &quot;&quot;Indian Ginseng&quot;&quot;, though the two are not related botanically.)</strong>
(Serves 1.) Slice the fresh ginseng root using a sharp knife or a vegetable peeler. Place 1 tablespoon of finely chopped ginseng root into a mug. Boil a large glass of water (about 250 mL) in a kettle. Once the water has come to a boil, take it off of the heat, and let it cool for 2 minutes. High levels of heat can destroy the beneficial properties of many herbs, including Ginseng. Pour 1 cup (240 mL) of the water into the mug with the chopped Ginseng root, cover the cup and let the tea steep for at least 5-10 minutes.The longer the tea is steeped, the stronger it will be. Strain the tea. Another method of preparation is to put a tablespoon of dried Ginseng root powder in a cup (240 mL) of water and to heat the water to just below the boiling point, and let steep at that tempeerature for a little longer, about 20 minutes.</li> <li><strong>Nettle leaf tea: The Nettle plant is high in polyphenols and antioxidants. A review of the research on polyphenols suggests that these powerful compounds may play a role in the prevention and management of chronic diseases related to inflammation, such as diabetes, obesity, cancer, and heart disease. Antioxidants are substances that protect the body from aging and cell damage. The leaves, stem and root of the Nettle plant have been used for centuries in herbal medicine, to treat ailments ranging from urinary tract infection, joint pain and arthritis and blood sugar management.</strong>
Combine Nettle leaves and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. If preferred, some Cinnamon powder could be added as well for flavour. Turn off the heat and let the mixture steep for at least 10 minutes. When it has cooled to slightly above body temperature anad is just pleasantly warm, strain the tea and add a little honey or Stevia to taste.</li> <li><strong>Sage tea: Sage / Salvia officinalis / Neelamulli / Salvi Tulasi / Salvia / Kamrkash is a commonly used spice in cuisines across the world, and hails from the mint family, like Rosemary, Thyme and Basil. Sage has proven antiviral properties and has been used across many cultures for its medicinal value.</strong>
Boil a cup of water, and add a teaspoon of dried or a tablespoon of fresh sage leaves. Allow the mixture to steep for 5-7 minutes and leave to cool. Add freshly squeezed lemon juice to taste when the tea is cool enough to be sipped.</li> <li><strong>Hunza tea: This is a herbal decoction specially recommended by Dr. Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury. Hunza tea is from Hunza valley in Pakistan, where the native people are remarkably healthy and long-lived. The tea is reputed for its anti-ageing properties, promotes skin health and counters diabetes.</strong>
(Serves 4.) Bring a little oveer 4 cups of water to boil in a saucepan and add to it the following ingredients: 12 pieces of Mint leaves, 8 pcs Holy basil or Tulasi leaves, 4 pcs green cardamom, 2 g cinnamon, and 20 g fresh ginger. Simmer for 5-7 minutes and switch off the heat. Allow the decoction to steep while cooling, and then add about 20 g organic jaggery and freshly squeezed lemon juice to taste before serving.</li></ul> <h3 id="typical-duration-of-treatment-10"><a href="#typical-duration-of-treatment-10" class="header-anchor">#</a> Typical duration of treatment:</h3> <p>Prophylactic treatment for regular use, mitigates infections without any known adverse effects, immune-supportive.</p> <h3 id="outcome-11"><a href="#outcome-11" class="header-anchor">#</a> Outcome:</h3> <p>Prophylactic, mitigates infections without any known adverse effects, immune-supportive.</p> <h3 id="significant-side-effects-11"><a href="#significant-side-effects-11" class="header-anchor">#</a> Significant side effects:</h3> <p>None known, supportive of overall health.</p> <h3 id="recommended-quantity-for-stocking-10"><a href="#recommended-quantity-for-stocking-10" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recommended quantity for stocking:</h3> <p>Uses household ingredients available in ordinary Indian grocery cuisine and stores.

It was a Randomized Control Trial, but could not be wholly double-blinded due to the sweet and distinctive flavour of honey, which could not be adequately replicated through a neutral placebo. The Nigella sativa was administered as capsules, and the control group received empty capsules.</p> <p><strong>A research study investigating the prophylactic potential of Nigella sativa is underway, led by the principal investigator of the HNS study, Dr. Sohaib Ashraf. It is expected to be completed by Feb 15, 2022.</strong></p> <p><strong><ins>NSO therapy:</ins></strong></p> <p><strong>In another study, all adult patients, with average age 36 years, with mild COVID-19 symptoms (defined as upper respiratory tract infection symptoms in the absence of clinical or radiological signs of pneumonia or hypoxia) presented to King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, were recruited for an open label randomized clinical trial (RCT) with Nigella seed oil, whereas the control group received only standard of care. Symptoms were daily monitored via telecommunication. Of these patients, 183 eligible patients were eventually recruited into the RCT with their consent.</strong> The primary outcome focused on the percentage of patients who recovered (symptom-free for 3 days) within 14-days.</p> <h3 id="protocol-and-treatment-approach-12"><a href="#protocol-and-treatment-approach-12" class="header-anchor">#</a> Protocol and treatment approach:</h3> <p>N. sativa L., a well-known food spice with a high medicinal value, originates from different historical backgrounds. Several active compounds have been identified in N. sativa L. including thymoquinone, and the antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of the seed are well explored in clinical research.</p> <p><strong>Honey + Nigella sativa (HNS) used in the treatment of moderate to severe Covid-19 infection:</strong>
The study used HNS as an adjunct therapy to standard care therapy as advised by their physician, comprising of antipyretics, antibiotics, supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation, if required.</p> <p><strong>The Honey + Nigella sativa adjunct therapy involved administering patients 1 g / kg / day of honey and 80 mg / kg / day of Nigella sativa for up to 13 days in each dose. These were given 2-3 times a day, depending on the patient's comfort with the dosage. The honey was dissolved in 1 large cup or 250 mL of warm water, while the Nigella sativa was provided in capsules. (A tablespoon of honey weighs approximately 21 g. A metric teaspoon of Black cumin seeds weighs about 5 g.)</strong></p> <p><strong><ins>Nigella seed oil (NSO) therapy:</ins></strong> <strong>The treatment adopted in the research study involved administering 500 mg NSO (MARNYS® Cuminmar) twice daily for 10 days to adult patients with mild Covid-19 symptoms, as adjunct therapy to standard of care.</strong></p> <p>Research published in the journal Vascular Pharmacology shows that a molecule found in Nigella sativa, also known as Black seed or Black cumin, binds to ACE2 receptors in the lungs, potentially stopping spike protein particles from inducing inflammation and vascular damage. The molecule is being studied for possible drug development. Researchers out of India investigated the effects of Nigellidine, an indazole alkaloid of black seed, using molecular docking for binding to different Angiotensin-binding proteins, as well as the spike glycoprotein. They found that nigellidine “strongly binds” to the spike protein at what is known as the hinge region or active site opening, which may in turn hamper its binding to ACE2 receptor surfaces.</p> <p>In a related study that was published last year in the journal Europe PMC, researchers learned that Nigellidine may potentially inhibit infection in several other ways. It was discovered early on that some people may suffer “Cytokine storms,” in which their immune systems are over-responding and causing more damage, or even death. Nigellidine was then studied and discovered to possess certain properties that may inhibit Cytokine storms, as well as impede infection, potentially making it an ideal drug candidate for further research. It is also hepato- and reno-protective, meaning it may help protect against liver and kidney damage. Furtthermore, Nigellidine was determined to possess unique immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory characteristics, as well as antioxidant potential strong enough to inhibit some pathogenic proteins. In their quest to uncover possible drug candidates to protect patients against hyperinflammation and other associated problems, the researchers learnt that Nigellidine may help with preventing such adverse effects.</p> <p>Besides Nigellicine, Nigellidine is found in the seed coat of Nigella sativa. Both of these constituents in their sulfated forms are extremely bioavailable, and along with Thymoquinone and Dithymoquinone, two other Black seed components, they show strong antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects that may be found useful with further clinical research.</p> <p>Black seed is also recognized as a metabolic protector, helping to improve lipid and blood sugar levels.</p> <h3 id="typical-duration-of-treatment-11"><a href="#typical-duration-of-treatment-11" class="header-anchor">#</a> Typical duration of treatment:</h3> <p>1-2 weeks, in a research study that used HNS as adjunct therapy to mainstream treatment.</p> <p>A research study reported that <strong>Honey + Nigella Sativa therapy (HNS), used as an adjunct therapy alongside mainstream treatment, was found to alleviate Covid-19 symptoms in 4 and 6 days in moderate and severe cases, respectively, compared to 7 and 13 days, respectively, in the control group. Viral clearance also occurred 4 days earlier for both moderate and severe cases in the HNS group, compared to the control group.</strong></p> <h3 id="outcome-12"><a href="#outcome-12" class="header-anchor">#</a> Outcome:</h3> <p><strong>Outcome of Honey + Nigella Sativa (HNS) therapy as adjunct to Standard Of Care in its first clinical trial on 313 patients in Pakistan with moderate to severe Covid-19:</strong> <strong>The intervention was found to alleviate Covid-19 symptoms in 4 and 6 days in moderate and severe cases, respectively, compared to 7 and 13 days, respectively, in the control group. Viral clearance also occurred 4 days earlier for both moderate and severe cases in the HNS group, compared to the control group. In addition, HNS reduced mortality among the severe patients. 30-day mortality was reported as 18.87 % in the control group, and 4 %, i.e., over four-fold lower in the HNS treatment group.</strong></p> <p>The study results show that HNS promotes viral clearance, reduces severity of the disease and mortality, and is a safe and effective therapy for moderate to severe Covid-19 cases, say researchers. Thus, HNS represents an affordable over the counter therapy and can either be used alone or in combination with other treatments to achieve potentiating effects against COVID-19.</p> <p><strong>Outcome of Nigella Seed Oil (NSO) therapy as adjunct to SOC in the recent clinical on 183 patients in Saudi Arabia with mild Covid-19 symptoms:</strong> <strong>The percentage of patients recovered in the NSO group during the 14-day study period was significantly higher than that in the control group (57 patients [63 %] versus 32 patients [35 %], respectively). Additionally, the average number of days required for recovery in the NSO group was significantly less, by about 2 days, compared with those in the control group receiving Standard Of Care (10.7 ± 3.3 days versus 12.4 ± 2.9 days, respectively).</strong> Specifically, NSO treatment had a pronounced effect on the duration of anosmia and runny nose.</p> <h3 id="significant-side-effects-12"><a href="#significant-side-effects-12" class="header-anchor">#</a> Significant side effects:</h3> <p>The safety profile of thymoquinone has been documented in many clinical trials, including our previous trial with asthmatic patients.A recent systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that used N. sativa L. showed no serious adverse effects on hepatic and renal function.</p> <h3 id="recommended-quantity-for-stocking-11"><a href="#recommended-quantity-for-stocking-11" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recommended quantity for stocking:</h3> <p>Both honey are common cooking ingredients found in Indian kitchens, and if not, 100-200 g of Nigella sativa and 250 mL of honey could be stocked.</p> <h3 id="price-11"><a href="#price-11" class="header-anchor">#</a> Price:</h3> <p><strong>HNS (Honey + Nigella sativa) therapy</strong>:</p> <p>The whole treatment course is reported to have cost less than $5.

CBD and its metabolite, 7-OH-CBD, but not congeneric Cannabinoids, potently block SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung epithelial cells. CBD acts after cellular infection, inhibiting viral gene expression and reversing many effects of SARS-CoV-2 on host gene transcription. CBD induces Interferon expression and up-regulates its antiviral signaling pathway. A cohort of human patients previously taking CBD had significantly lower SARSCoV-2 infection incidence of up to an order of magnitude relative to matched pairs or the general population. The study highlighted CBD, and its active metabolite, 7-OH-CBD, as potential preventative agents and therapeutic treatments for SARS-CoV-2 at early stages of infection.
