To make matters worse, it also seems evident that there is a hugely empowered and concerted movement to grant preferential notice and space to certain kinds of antidotes to the pandemic over others.

Across a variety of cultures and socioeconomic conditions, saliva tests were generally much preferred to nasopharyngeal tests and persons seemed largely confident that they could self-sample. For positive patients defined as those with the amplification of 2 specific target genes with Ct values below 35, the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR on saliva samples was similar to nasopharyngeal samples despite the broad range of challenging circumstances in a tropical environment (French Guiana).</p></li></ul> <h3 id="_3-later-treatment-over-early-treatment-of-the-infection"><a href="#_3-later-treatment-over-early-treatment-of-the-infection" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3.

This paper cites several studies showing that phototherapy has immense potential to reduce the impact of coronavirus diseases, and offers suggested ways that the healthcare industry can integrate modern light technologies in the fight against COVID-19 and other infections. The evidence shows that violet / blue (400–470 nm) light is antimicrobial against numerous bacteria, and that it accounts for Niels Ryberg Finsen's Nobel-winning treatment of tuberculosis. Further evidence shows that blue light inactivates several viruses, including the common flu coronavirus, and that in experimental animals, red and near infrared light reduce respiratory disorders, similar to those complications associated with coronavirus infection. Moreover, in patients, red light has been shown to alleviate chronic obstructive lung disease and bronchial asthma. These findings call for urgent efforts to further explore the clinical value of light, and not wait for another pandemic to serve as a reminder. The ubiquity of inexpensive light emitting lasers and light emitting diodes (LEDs), makes it relatively easy to develop safe low-cost light-based devices with the potential to reduce infections, sanitize equipment, hospital facilities, emergency care vehicles, homes, and the general environment as pilot studies have shown.</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/determination-of-the-effectiveness-of-chlorine-dioxide-in-the-treatment-of-covid19-67319.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Determination of the Effectiveness of Chlorine Dioxide in the Treatment of COVID-19<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>; Insignares-Carrione Eduardo et al.; Molecular and Genetic Medicine; 2021
Conclusion:
In conclusion, [it can be affirmed] without a doubt, ... that the data in most of the variables (P&lt;0.05) obtained indicate that chlorine dioxide is effective in the treatment of COVID-19, making RT-PCR negative in one hundred percent of cases at 7 days, significantly and rapidly modifying the symptoms of the disease, significantly reducing laboratory parameters to normality within 14 to 21 days. [It is recommended to conduct] randomized double-blind studies and delving into studies of toxicological safety and therapeutic efficacy of chlorine dioxide in pathologies of epidemiological impact in the near future.</p></li> <li><p>FDA.gov: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why You Should Not Use Ivermectin to Treat or Prevent COVID-19<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>
The FDA has not authorized or approved ivermectin for use in preventing or treating COVID-19 in humans or animals. Ivermectin is approved for human use to treat infections caused by some parasitic worms and head lice and skin conditions like rosacea.
Currently available data do not show ivermectin is effective against COVID-19. Clinical trials assessing ivermectin tablets for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 in people are ongoing.</p></li> <li><p>covexit.com (Covid-19 News &amp; Policy Analysis): <a href="https://covexit.com/flccc-alliance-blasts-who-over-ivermectin-guideline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FLCCC Alliance Blasts WHO over Ivermectin Guideline<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>; April 1, 2021.
One of the first reactions to the new WHO guideline over Ivermectin came from the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, which issued a statement on the very same day, highlighting major flaws in the new guideline. FLCCC is “disappointed” by “what appears to be a deliberate omission of data by the World Health Organization in arriving at its decision to not recommend ivermectin to prevent and treat COVID-19. The latest guidance from WHO ignores several large clinical trials where ivermectin was proven to prevent mortality by more than 68%.” FLCCC’s statement warns countries about following the new WHO guideline: “If the WHO guidance is followed, it will result in a further deprivation of a lifesaving drug and will only prolong the pandemic as it will continue to threaten the health of the global population.&quot;&quot; “I am deeply troubled that the WHO made this hasty decision on guidance before reviewing all available data,” said Pierre Kory, MD, MPH, president and chief medical officer of the FLCCC. “Their recommendation ignores the evidence, creates more controversy, and will only lead to continuing suffering and death from COVID-19.”</p></li> <li><p>covexit.com (Covid-19 News &amp; Policy Analysis): <a href="https://covexit.com/the-8th-day-therapy-for-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 8th Day Therapy for COVID-19<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>; May 4, 2021
This article is about the “8th Day Therapy” concept developed by Dr Shankara Chetty from South Africa, who has treated some 4,000 COVID-19 patients [in a rural, ill-equipped outpatient setting, with zero fatalities] and has studied at the same time the pathogenesis of the disease and fine-tuned his treatments.</p></li></ul> <p>So much so that it would perhaps not be an exaggeration to say that this pandemic has been as much a pandemic of disinformation and administrative folly as a pandemic of an unusually debilitating influenza virus.</p> <p>This website is a small effort to compile a lot of the information in the public domain regarding highly effective and truly (as opposed to nominally or officially) evidence-based treatments for Covid-19. A majority of these treatments have demonstrated a nearly 100 % cure rate in clinical trials, and good longer term prognoses, or at least, have shown a significant improvement in outcome when used as adjunct therapy.</p> <p><em>However, it is also true that a majority of these treatments have not found support in mainstream health policy, nor endorsement by top-tier organizations like the WHO, FDA, CDC, and other global and regional regulatory authorities. Sometimes these treatments have been accepted and later retracted by reputable medical journals under interesting circumstances. More often, they have been killed by neglect in policy and in discourse, and a simple lack of vehicles or media to propagate awareness of them to the masses.</em></p> <p><strong>Nonetheless these treatments derive considerable authority from evidentiary trials and publications, from the real-life testimonies of thousands or tens of thousands of clinical practitioners on the field who are using these remedies with great success, and the approval of millions of patients who have together benefitted from the willingness and competence of their physicians to provide such truly evidence-based, empirically validated treatments.</strong></p> <p>As there are a very large number of potentially viable and apparently highly effective treatment options known, an attempt was made to combine the most evidence-based, nontoxic, and the most mutually compatible of these therapies together to create a robust early stage home treatment modality for any Covid-like infection, i.e. any respiratory airborne influenza, potentially causing severe inflammation, so that the treatment could be begun and mitigate the infection at the earliest sign of symptoms, even before Covid-19 was diagnosed. Moreover, by combining several potent adjunct, compatible solutions, their benefits could be compounded. A similar attempt was made also to create a sensible prophylaxing regimen, a regimen for the treatment of long-Covid, as well as to counter the short and long term inflammation induced by the vaccines. Of these, the treatment regimens for vaccine-induced inflammation and to a lesser extent, long-Covid, are the least well understood and evidence-based.</p> <p><strong>These treatments</strong> (in each therapeutic category, with different categories being documented as separate sheets) <strong>are not organized or listed in any rigorous order, but <em>in general, the listing is in descending order of the official recognition, and mainstream visibility of these alternate / integrative therapies.</em> This does not, by any means, imply that the topmost therapies in each sheet of this document, or those listed first in each category, are the most effective and recommended remedies, for it does appear that many lesser known remedies- like the integrative therapy Haldi30, or Ozone therapy, or CDS therapy, to name a few- were extraordinarily effective. Furthermore, these also appear to have widespread implications in healthcare, and it appears probable that they may come to be recruited to serve as first line therapies against a wide variety of potentially devastating infections, including tuberculosis and even Ebola.</strong></p> <p><strong>It is humbly hoped that interested physicians and members of the public could make an effort to study, and if satisfied, apply, demand, store and propagate these protocols, as (lest we forget) it is very much our right to judge and choose, as best we can, how we protect ourselves against the imminent threat.</strong></p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
