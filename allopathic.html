This will facilitate the development of herd immunity and help prevent future COVID-19 pandemics. However, if these patients desire prophylaxis against COVID-19, then they should take the protocol noted below.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Moderate-Risk Patients:</strong> Patients from this category are healthy but have high potential viral-load exposure. This group includes medical personnel, caregivers of high-risk patients, people who use public transportation, first responders and other essential personnel who are crucial to the continued functioning of society. These patients should be encouraged to take prophylaxis against COVID-19 in accordance with the protocol noted below.</p></li> <li><p><strong>High-Risk Patients:</strong> Patients are considered high risk if they are over the age of 60, or if they are younger than 60 but they have comorbidities, that is, they have other health conditions that put them at risk. These patients have between a 5 to 10 percent mortality rate if they are infected with COVID-19.

Therefore post-exposure prophylaxis should be provided immediately for all residents and all the staff. The recommended regimen is as follows:
<ul><li>Vitamin D – 4000 iu Daily</li> <li>Zinc elemental – 25 mg Daily</li> <li>Ivermectin:  Dose 1 of 0.2 mg / kg (body weight) on Day 1; Dose 2 of 0.2 mg / kg (body weight) on Day 3; Weekly maintenance dose of 0.05 mg / kg (body weight), or a monthly maintenance dose of 0.2 mg / kg.</li> <li>Vitamin C and / or a quality multivitamin supplement, and possibly Quercetin also recommended.</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Early Outpatient Treatment:</strong> For the residents having tested positive, or with suspected COVID-19, even before the confirmatory test result is known, an early outpatient treatment protocol needs to be immediately provided, within 2 days of first symptoms:
<ul><li>Ivermectin
<ul><li>Dose 1 of 0.2 mg / kg (body weight) on Day 1</li> <li>Dose 2 of 0.2 mg / kg (body weight) on Day 3 and</li> <li>Dose 3 of 0.2 mg / kg on Day 5</li></ul></li> <li>Doxycycline monohydrate 100 mg twice a day for Days 1 - 5</li> <li>Continuation of Vitamin D, Zinc and possibly other supplements.

Marik, Professor of Medicine and Chief of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, Virginia, and championed by a team of highly experienced physicians. Dr. Marik has authored 80 book chapters and 500 journal publications, with over 44,000 citations and an h-index of 98. He has delivered over 350 lectures at international conferences, and is co-founder of the Front Line Covid Critical Care Alliance. The scientific protocol, called the EVMS protocol, was developed by Dr. Marik and based on his famous safe, effective treatment protocol for sepsis.</p> <p>Ivermectin was discovered in the 1970s and is on the World Health Organization (WHO) list of essential medicines.</p> <p>Having said that, Dr. Kory reported that there are very few places in the world where the MATH+ protocol is being used, such as Germany or Ukraine (where it is the authorized standard of care). In many other places, like the US, ivermectin has been removed from the therapeutic protocols of most hospitals, but clinicians are prescribing it under the table. The NIH hasn't adopted the protocol.</p> <h3 id="protocol-and-treatment-approach-2"><a href="#protocol-and-treatment-approach-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Protocol and treatment approach:</h3> <p><strong>FLCCC I-MASK+ Protocol for general prevention and early outpatient treatment of COVID-19 (updated on Sept 1, 2021, to be adapted to the Delta variant):</strong></p> <p><strong>The initial MATH+ protocol was released in April 2020. In early July and August, it was updated to include Quercetin and a number of optional nutrients and drugs, not only for critical care but also for prophylaxis and mild disease being treated at home. Now once again in recent months, FLCCC medical team strengthened the I-MASK+ prevention &amp; early treatment protocol to counter the new COVID-19 variant.</strong></p> <p>There is evidence that vitamin C and Quercetin co-administration exerts a synergistic antiviral action due to overlapping antiviral and immuno-modulatory properties and the capacity of Ascorbate to recycle Quercetin, increasing its efficacy.

Dr. Kory mentioned that he had caught Covid, a milder form with only sinusitis and nasal congestion, while he was prophylaxing on Ivermectin, which should be considered a breakthrough from the FLCCC prophylactic protocol. These breakthroughs did occasionally occur until Jan / Feb, 2021, when the protocol called for ivermectin dosing once in two weeks. <strong>There have been no known reports of breakthroughs after the frequency was increased to once a week in the updated protocol. The viral loads are orders of magnitude higher with the Delta variant than with the alpha and other common variants. Ivermectin has a very tight dose response relationship with this virus.There is no clear understanding of the right dosing, only a heuristical understanding, which appears to work well.</strong></p> <p>Dr. Kory has been collaborating with <strong>Dr. Flavio A. Cadegiani, Brazil</strong>, who is a top medical researcher and academician there. Dr. Cadegiani has been very actively involved in vast numbers of large scale clinical researches on Covid, and his work has contributed to important innovations in effective treatment protocols, including the use of anti-androgens like Proxalutamide. Dr. Kory's own research into androgen-blockers has led to the conclusion that they are a very underutilized and powerful therapeutic strategy. Dr. Cadegiani is a very rigorous researcher who used ivermectin therapy for his control groups in his clinical trials.</p> <p>Dr. Cadegiani established that <strong>Ivermectin and Nitazoxanide are both antiparasitic drugs with proven antiviral properties, and both are clinically equivalent in their effect for Covid-19.</strong> He adapted the MATH+ protocol for the aggressive Gamma variant that struck Brazil, incorporating the various effective treatment modalities discovered by other clinicians. <strong>Dr. Cadegiani also discovered through randomized control trials that Ivermectin and Nitazoxanide have synergistic properties and work better together therapeutically than each in isolation. Therefore the Gamma protocol recommends the use of both together for the highest risk strata of patients, with the Ivermectin dosage sometimes as high as 1.0 mg/kg. With the Delta variant, it was acceptable to use doses upto 0.6 mg/kg, and 0.3-0.4 mg/kg was effective with the other milder variants.</strong></p> <p>The <strong>androgen suppressor Proxalutamide, though new and pending regulatory approval, was found to drastically reduce mortality rate in clinical trials. Spironolactone is a milder androgen suppressor and perhaps useful in outpatient treatment, and Bicalutamide and Flutamide are stronger drugs in this category.</strong> They are found to be safe for both men and women, and <strong>were really the game-changers in the battle with the Gamma variant. Androgen-blocking is an excellent anti-inflammatory agent and works well both in the early and later stage of the therapy.</strong> Androgen-blockers work by inhibiting the enzyme TMPRSS2 that facilitates the binding of the ACE2 receptor to the spike protein of the virus.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5359817/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bromhexine<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> is useful and works to clear phlegm in the respiratory tract by also inhibiting the TMPRSS2 enzyme, but Budesonide doesn't seem to be very helpful.

The Secretary of Health revealed that the local health officials had been distributing ivermecting throughout the local city population, many people were prophylaxing, and everybody was using it for early treatment. There were a large number of cases in the city and the prophylactic dosage of ivermectin used was 0.2 mg / kg every 7-10 days, which was probably too low for the highly infectious Gamma variant.

Dr. Pierre Kory doesn't believe that there is any risk with twice a week ivermectin prophylaxing, even with 0.4 mg/kg dosing, as the drug has been used extensively, especially very strong doses in cancer therapy. He cites Brazilian Dr. Flavio Cadegiani who has used ivermectin dosages as high as 1.0 mg/kg with Gamma variant infections in hospitalized patients.</li></ul> <p>Ivermectin has been used fairly safely for over 40 years in clinical practice. However it is known to be toxic in large doses, and not recommended for children weighing less than 15 kg, for pregnant women and lactating mothers. In particular, Ivermectin is not advised for persons with compromised kidney or liver function, or those infected with the parasite Loa Loa.</p> <p>Headache, dizziness, muscle pain, nausea, or diarrhea may occur. Tell the consulting doctor right away if any of these rare but very serious side effects occur: neck/back pain, swelling face/arms/hands/feet, chest pain, fast heartbeat, confusion, seizures, loss of consciousness. A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, seek immediate medical attention if any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction are noticed, including: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face / tongue / throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing. This is not a complete list of possible side effects. If other effects not listed above are noticed, contact doctor or pharmacist.</p> <p>Ivermectin is hazardous to those suffering from allergies to the medication, and there are possibilities of adverse drug interactions with other allopathic or herbal medications.</p> <p>Ivermectin is most commonly used in veterinary practice, and it is very important to use human-grade Ivermectin, not from pet stores.</p> <p>For more information on safety of HCQ and other medicines in the algorithm, check the <a href="http://c19study.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">c19study.com<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> website that summarizes more than 278 studies of HCQ-based treatment, which are particularly favorable when HCQ is used in the first few days of COVID-19 symptoms as recommended in the above algorithm.</p> <h3 id="recommended-quantity-for-stocking-2"><a href="#recommended-quantity-for-stocking-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recommended quantity for stocking:</h3> <p>Treatment can be undertaken only under doctor's guidance and supervision.</p> <h3 id="price-2"><a href="#price-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Price:</h3> <p>The first line of drugs used in the protocol are commonly used and inexpensive.

HCQ studies supports the following (COVID-19 Treatment, 2020):</p> <ol><li>63% of studies of HCQ administered late in the hospital course have demonstrated benefit.</li> <li>100% of the early treatment studies have demonstrated benefit with a composite 64% relative risk reduction in the progression of disease, hospitalization, and death (Arshad et al., 2020; Mikami et al., 2020; Prodromos and Rumschlag, 2020; Rosenberg et al., 2020).
The small randomized trials to date are inconclusive for the following reasons: 1) no placebo control, 2) unblinded, 3) altered primary endpoints, 4) biased unblinded physician assigned endpoints (such as need for oxygen), 5) markedly truncated sample sizes and administrative termination of trials, 6) pretreatment with other antivirals.</li></ol> <p><strong>Quercetin</strong>: The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) states, &quot;&quot;(Quercetin) is much less potent than HCQ as a Zinc transporter, and it does not reach the high concentrations in lung cells that HCQ does. Quercetin may help reduce risk of viral illness if you are basically healthy. But it is not potent enough to replace HCQ for treatment of COVID once you have symptoms, and it does not adequately get into lung tissue unless you take massive doses (3-5 grams a day), which cause significant GI side effects such as diarrhea.</p> <p><strong>Ivermectin</strong>: Ivermectin (IVM) is a broad spectrum anti-parasitic agent that has been shown to have anti-viral activity against a range of viruses including recently, SARS-CoV-2 (Heidary and Gharebaghi, 2020).  There are a number of randomized and prospective studies and all have shown efficacy in clinical outcomes at the time of this report (Alam et al., 2020; Chowdhury et al., 2020; Gorial et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2020; Nunez et al., 2020). . In the ICON study, IVM use in the hospital was associated with a 48% relative risk reduction in COVID-19 mortality (Rajter et al., 2020). Currently, there are 36 randomized clinical trials of ivermectin alone or in combination for ambulatory and hospitalized patients listed on clinicaltrials.gov.</p> <p><strong>Favipravir</strong>: Favipiravir is an oral selective inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and is approved for ambulatory use in COVID19 in multiple countries (Coomes and Haghbayan, 2020). Favipiravir is safe and it shortens viral nasal shedding to less than 7 days in most studies (Ivashchenko et al., 2020; Pilkington et al., 2020).</p> <p><strong>Antibiotics  with intracellular anti-infective activity:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Azithromycin</strong> is a commonly used macrolide antibiotic that has antiviral properties mainly attributed to reduced endosomal transfer of virions as well as established anti-inflammatory effects (Pani et al., 2020). French reports indicated that Azithromycin in combination with HCQ was associated with reduced durations of viral shedding, fewer hospitalizations, and reduced mortality as compared to those untreated (Lagier et al., 2020; Million et al., 2020). In a large observational inpatient study (n = 2451), those who received AZM alone had an adjusted hazard ratio for mortality of 1.05, 95% CI 0.68-1.62, P = 0.83 (Colunga Biancatelli et al., 2020). The combination of HCQ and AZM has been considered a standard of care outside the US for COVID-19 in more than 300,000 older adults with multiple comorbidities (Risch, 2020).</li> <li><strong>Doxycycline</strong> is another common antibiotic with multiple intracellular effects that may reduce viral replication, cellular damage, and expression of inflammatory factors (Malek et al., 2020; Sodhi and Etminan, 2020). It has been shown to have in vitro activity against COVID-19 at clinically used concentrations, acting in post-entry stages of the infection with SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells (Gendrot et al., 2020). It has also been shown to concentrate in the lungs at levels twice that of plasma. When combined with Ivermectin early in the infection it appears to enhance efficacy to near complete eradication of COVID-19 in less than 10 days.</li> <li><strong>Corticosteroids</strong>: &quot;Among COVID-19 patients, serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels are elevated in the critically ill (Han et al., 2020). In COVID-19, some of the first respiratory findings are cough and difficulty breathing. These features are attributable to inflammation and cytokine activation. Early use of oral corticosteroids is a rational intervention for COVID-19 patients with these features as they would be in other inflammatory lung disorders (Kolilekas et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020). In particular, a meta-analysis involving 1703 critically ill COVID-19 patients found a 36% relative risk reduction in death (Sterne et al., 2020) due to dexamethasone.&quot;</li> <li><strong>Anticoagulants</strong>: &quot;Autopsy studies have described pulmonary micro thrombosis and overt embolism with deep venous thrombus found in over half of fatal COVID-19 cases (Ackermann et al., 2020; Burlacu et al., 2020). These observations support the hypothesis that a unique endothelial injury and thrombosis are playing a role in oxygen desaturation, a cardinal reason for hospitalization and supportive care (Zhang et al., 2020b).<br>&quot;Preemptive use of low molecular weight heparin or novel anticoagulants have been associated with &gt; 50% reduction in COVID-19 mortality (Billett et al., 2020). Anticoagulants also reduce death in COVID-19 hospitalized patients with thrombotic complications, elevated D-dimer levels, and higher comorbidity scores (Tang et al., 2020) . Finally, many acutely ill outpatients also have general indications or risk for cardioembolic/venous thromboembolic prophylaxis applicable to COVID-19 (Moores et al., 2020; Ruocco et al., 2020).<br> &quot;Given reports of catastrophic stroke and systemic thromboembolism and the large reductions in mortality for both prophylactic and  therapeutic use, administration of Aspirin 325 mg po qd for all COVID-19 high-risk patients and systemic anticoagulation is prudent in patients with a history of heart, lung, kidney, or malignant disease (Yamakawa et al., 2020).&quot;</li> <li><strong>Colchine</strong>, in the GRECCO-19 randomized open-label trial in 105 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (treated with HCQ and Azithromycin in 98 and 93% respectively) found that Colchicine was associated with a reduction in D-dimer levels and improved clinical outcomes (Deftereos et al., 2020).</li></ul> <h3 id="significant-side-effects-3"><a href="#significant-side-effects-3" class="header-anchor">#</a> Significant side effects:</h3> <ul><li><p><strong>HCQ</strong>: Hydroxychloroquine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1955, has been used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide since then, is sold over the counter in many countries and has a well characterized safety profile (Fram et al., 2020; Schrezenmeier and Dörner, 2020). Asymptomatic QT prolongation is well-recognized though an infrequent (&lt; 1%) occurrence with HCQ (Prodromos et al., 2020). In those with glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency HCQ should not be used (Aguilar, 2020). In the setting of acute severe COVID-19 illness, symptomatic arrhythmias can develop in the absence of HCQ and are attributed to cytokine storm and critical illness (Elsaid et al., 2020). Data safety and monitoring boards have not declared safety concerns in HCQ clinical trial published to date. Rare patients with a personal or family history of prolonged QT syndrome, those on additional QT prolonging, contraindicated drugs (e.g. dofetilide, sotalol), should be treated with caution and a plan to monitor the QTc in the ambulatory setting. A typical HCQ regimen is 200 mg bid for 5 to 30 days depending on continued symptoms.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ivermectin</strong>: This drug is well tolerated, has a high therapeutic index and proven safety profile with over 3.7 billion treatments, and has been used alone or combined with either doxycycline or azithromycin in early clinical studies of patients with COVID-19 (Rahman et al., 2020).<br> For more information on safety of HCQ and other medicines in the algorithm, check the <a href="http://c19study.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">c19study.com<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> website that summarizes more than 278 studies of HCQ-based treatment, which are particularly favorable when HCQ is used in the first few days of COVID-19 symptoms as recommended in the above algorithm.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Corticosteroids</strong>: It was reported that safety concerns regarding prolonged viral replication with steroids have not been substantiated (Masiá et al., 2020).<br> The following scientific article attempts to identify an association between the alarming rise of mucormycosis in advanced Covid patients in India during the second wave, and the common practice of excessive prescription of Zinc (up to 50 mg per day), antibiotics like Azithromycin, and Corticosteroids even in the early days of disease onset, as well as the widespread use of scalding steam to &quot;disinfect&quot; the upper respiratory tract by many households:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/infection-control-and-hospital-epidemiology/article/look-into-the-relationship-between-outdated-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid19-treatment-protocols-and-the-overwhelming-rise-of-mucormycosis-in-covid19-patients-in-india/FA2045E662B0D8C7AEAD2CF1610A8D2E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A look into the relationship between outdated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment protocols and the overwhelming rise of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients in India; Jamal &amp; Rayapati; Infectious Control &amp; Hospital Epidemiology; Aug 27, 2021<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Diluted (1%) Povidone Iodine (Betadine) mouth wash</strong>: Povidone-iodine can safely be used in the nose at concentrations up to 1.25% and in the mouth at concentrations up to 2.5% for up to 5 months. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0145561320932318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Povidone-iodine rapidly inactivates coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS, when applied for as little as 15 seconds.<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a><br></p> <ul><li><ins>Pregnancy Warning:</ins> If pregnant, ask a health professional before use.</li></ul></li></ul> <h3 id="recommended-quantity-for-stocking-3"><a href="#recommended-quantity-for-stocking-3" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recommended quantity for stocking:</h3> <p>The OTC nutraceutical products could be bought in advance and stocked for early home-based treatment.</p> <h3 id="price-3"><a href="#price-3" class="header-anchor">#</a> Price:</h3> <p>INR 25-70 for 4 12mg ivermectin tablets and doxycycline being much cheaper.

It is also well-known that respiratory viruses cause inflammatory disease, and this is an important focus of therapy for respiratory viruses, in general.</strong></p> <p>Dr. Chetty's <strong>systematization of the disease pathology and observation of the disease presentation at different points of the timeline post vaccination is an example of the keen observation</strong> that a doctor must possess in his clinical practice. This is how clinical practice and community medicine must work, with <strong>doctors sharing information on the ground.</strong></p> <p><strong>&quot;There is always a better mousetrap, there are better solutions.</strong> It is important to adapt therapy to the changing context in the pandemic, and it is always possible to find better solutions. There is no need to be afraid of this challenge. Such challenges are normal, and <strong>therapies must be dynamically changing.&quot; It is important to appreciate that as we go forward, there will emerge better therapeutic solutions to the pandemic.</strong> For example, the following therapeutic products may be repurposed to improve the current best treatment protocols for Covid-19: <strong>Cyclosporine</strong>, the immunosuppressant long used to preempt the body's rejections of transplants, might work. <strong>Fenofibrate</strong>, which is mainly used to lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, the HIV and antiretroviral drug <strong>Kaletra</strong>, the anti-inflammatory drug <strong>Colchicine</strong>, <strong>Interferons</strong>, which belong to a class of signalling proteins called cytokines and are used as antiviral therapeutic agents, <strong>Hydroxychloroquine</strong>, <strong>Ivermectin</strong>, the androgen blockers <strong>Spironolactone</strong> and <strong>Eplerenone</strong> (ordinarily used to treat high blood pressure), and more. Dr. Urso has repurposed many of these in his clinical protocols, even in ophthalmology for many years. <strong>Therefore it may not be difficult to innovate new therapeutic options to treat Covid better, even the aggressive variants, and it is exciting to meet the challenges entailed.</strong></p> <p><strong>The patients who have the greatest risk of severe infection wiith the delta variant are those with insulin resistance, which is different from the pathology of the previous milder variants. Dr. Urso has been trying to share protocol innovations with clinical practitioners who are seeking to improve upon existing treatment modalities, and especially doctors in ER care.</strong> These protocols <strong>primarily use Ivermectin and / or HCQ.</strong></p> <p>The potent first generation antihistamine <strong>Cyproheptadine</strong> has been especially effective with the Delta variant. Patients don't die of the virus but the body's own inflammatory response to the spike proteins, and Dr. Urso began to prescribed <strong>corticosteroids</strong> very early. It is <strong>very important to maintain vitamin D levels about 50 ng/dl, and if there is one step one might take to preempt or combat Covid, it is maintaining healthy blood levels of D, which would most effectively preempt a cytokine storm.</strong> Patients who have had bariatric surgery or a gall bladder operation, they would need higher levels of supplementation due to reduced absorption.

A few bodies like the FLCCC hope to propagate the value of effective early treatment protocols, as well as shed light on the Covid vaccines. The prescription of Covid vaccines to young people who are not at any significant risk from the disease, and to people who have been infected and are already naturally immune to the disease, seems &quot;ludicrous&quot;. <strong>Covid-recovered individuals are likely to have B- and T-cell immunity to the virus' spikes, membranes, envelope, nucleocapsids and other parts of the virus and not just an isolated component of the virus, unlike vaccine-induced immunity. Therefore they have an essentially 0 percent chance of reinfection even by mutant strains of the virus.

Dr. Urso is a firm believer in the value of early outpatient treatment of Covid-19 and its variants with Ivermectin and HCQ as the main line of therapy, and supplemented or supported by a wide portfolio of other drugs like antiviral agents, vital immune-suppportive nutrients, corticosteroids, antihistamines, MAbs, androgen blockers etc., based on the results of hundreds of successful clinical trials by clinicians across the world.</p> <h3 id="significant-side-effects-4"><a href="#significant-side-effects-4" class="header-anchor">#</a> Significant side effects:</h3> <p>Many of the drugs described in these protocols have significant side effects, and especially when the therapeutic doses are exceeded.

The doctor, practising in South Africa, has a considerable experience with the outpatient treatment of COVID-19. He holds a degree in medicine and surgery and also has advanced education in genetics, advanced biology, biochemistry and microbiology.</p> <p><strong>Dr. Chetty's observations of Covid symptoms in his patients, and the motivation for his protocol:</strong>
Dr. Chetty observed that the new disease Covid presented as a <strong>bi-phasic illness</strong>, where the initial illness was an ordinary respiratory illness, with unusual symptoms such as loss of smell and taste and sore throat, The entire course of the illness presented with an unusual non-linear progression of symptoms where many patients retrogressed sharply on the eighth day after commencement of the first symptoms, even after seeming (like other patients) to be improving steadily after the fourth or fifth day. In fact, a majority of patients recovered from the first phase of illness by the sixth day, so much so that even some patients who relapsed had been preparing to return to work very soon. <strong>Doxycycline was a drug of choice added to treatment of the first phase of the illness</strong>, for its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties through inhibition of protein synthesis and viral replication. <strong>Primary contacts were also prophylactically treated with Doxycyclin</strong>, which was therefore a mainstay of the treatment. <strong>Aspirin too was added to the early protocol to address the blood clotting issues that occurred later</strong>, depending on patient's D-dimer results and predisposition.</p> <p>The relapse manifested as breathlessness or dyspnoea, and in a few such patients, the disability took weeks or even months to resolve (&quot;long Covid&quot;). These observations led to the inference that the supposed relapse of severe symptoms were not owing so much to the Covid pathogen, as due to the body's own <strong>hypersensitivity</strong> or severe allergic response. <strong>In other words, the hospitalized patients were not suffering from the viral pneumonia with which they were misdiagnosed and treated, but from hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and high definition CT and X-ray could not tell the two apart.</strong></p> <p>In Dr.Chetty's own words, <strong>“With hyper-sensitivity, the most important thing is to start treatment early. The longer you leave it, the cascade of mediators will result in other sequalae and culminate into a cytokine storm. But like with other hyper-sensitivity reactions, if caught early, they are easy to cut in. So my entire focus became the eighth day. When patients came into my practice, I would Interrogate them about the onset of the symptoms, the exact day they started feeling unwell. I would then advise them about what might transpire exactly a week later, which is the eighth day, and what symptoms to start looking for. In the second wave, I notice there was a collection of symptoms  that seemed to idle the onset of this hypersensitivity reaction, and not necessarily dyspnea, but body aches and pains. This seemed to be very typical of an allergic reaction, that you would see with rheumatoid arthritis, with joint pain. There was fatigue, to the point that patients wanted to sleep, or the onset of dyspnea. I educated patients about these symptoms, and that they should not discount these symptoms, even if it was a solitary symptom and mild. Any change from the 7th to the 8th day should be reported.”</strong> Dr. Chetty reports that a large percentage of patients, about 70 %, did not report any worsening of symptoms on the 8th day, and thus did not enter the second, hypersensitivty phase. However those that did express the hypersensitivity symptoms on the 8th day sometimes advanced to a critical stage in a very short duration of time, needing hospitalization and intensive care in a day or two. Some others had only mild symptoms. Yet others had moderate symptoms that, if not treated properly, would persist for a long time and be classified as long-Covid.</p> <p>The speed to recovery when using medication is vitally important. Therefore he adopted the measure of preempting the hypersensitivity phase, the severe eighth-day immune response, through quick and simple treatment, in the form of <strong>starting patients on a simple H1-antihistamine like Promethazine 25 mg, and 80 mg Prednisone, upon the first onset of dypnoea</strong>. Dr. Chetty's preferred antihistamine was promethazine, a first-generation antihistamine and antipsychotic for its broad diversity of effect, that also is mildly sedative to relieve anxiety in patients who tended to feel it, and which had been used to alleviate sleeping difficulties. This diagnostic approach, of treating dyspnoea as an inflammatory response to Covid than a symptom of Covid, and <strong>using an antihistamine in addition to steroids, proved very effective</strong>, and patients often began recovery within hours after presenting with dyspnoea. Being hypersensitivity, <strong>Monteleukast</strong> was added to the therapy on the appearance of symptoms on the 8th day, being a commonly prescribed medication for asthmatic and anaphylactoid reactions, especially where the offending allergen is unknown. <strong>With Promethazine and Monteleukast, the recovery was found to be much quicker than with steroids alone.</strong></p> <p><strong>Corticosteroid Prednisone, using the following dosage:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>50 mg started on the first day seemed adequate as a starting dose for most patients in the first wave, but which needed to be escalated according to the severity of symptoms.</strong></li> <li><strong>80-100 mg was found to be required from the first day in the second wave, with the more aggressive South African variant.</strong></li> <li>It was found very important not to use too low a dosage as this often results in scarring and impedes full recovery. The lower the dosage of steroid used, the longer the time taken to turnaround and longer the exposure to steroids. Therefore a very high dosage of steroid was administered in Dr. Chetty's treatments.</li> <li>It is important to escalate the dosage to suit severity of symptoms, especially if there is not noticeable improvement after the first day.</li></ul> <p><strong>Interleukins and CRP levels were used to assess the extent of inflammation and efficacy of treatment during the 8th Day Therapy. These markers changed exponentially post the 8th day in patients who suffered from the severe hypersensitivity phase. Even very high values (interleukins in 500s, CRPs in 8900s) of these biomarkers could be turned around in 3-4 days.</strong></p> <p><strong>Other observations:</strong></p> <ul><li>Dr. Chetty has used <strong>Budesonoid</strong>, which appeared to work as well, especially with patients who had a chronic cough, but not in the powder formulations.</li> <li><strong>The antihistamine Promethazine appears to have had the greatest efficacy in reducing the severity of the hypersensitivity response.</strong></li> <li><strong>The antihistamine (Promethazine), Montelukast 10 mg, Aspirin (Ecotrin) 325 mg have to be continued for at least a month after the resolution of symptoms, for if stopped too early, there is a possibility of rebound.</strong></li> <li>Dr. Chetty also observed that preexisting allergies tend to be exacerbated by Covid, and therefore need better management as well.</li> <li><strong>He believes that long Covid is simply untreated or undertreated Covid,.</strong></li> <li>Speed to recovery can be hastened using intramuscular antihistamines and IV steroids.</li> <li>The treatment protocol included the use of hydrochloroquine, azithromycin and doxycycline to combat the viral component and antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists and steroids, amongst others, for the Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.</li></ul> <p><strong>Second Wave:</strong>
It became obvious in the second wave that the culprit provoking the hypersensitivity response on the 8th day was the spike protein, as the variants were mutated only in the spike protein. The variants had greater affinity for the gut ACE receptors, and there were gastrointestinal disorders among the symptoms. Also the second wave was far more contagious and triggered a far more severe hypersensitivity reaction on the 8th day, which required a far higher dose of steroid to suppress than in the first wave. <strong>In the third wave, the Delta variant was predominant in South Africa. <a href="/covidcures/allopathic.html#protocol-and-treatment-approach-7">The unique pathologies of this variant and adaptation of the therapy to them are described in a later section.</a></strong></p> <h3 id="typical-duration-of-treatment-6"><a href="#typical-duration-of-treatment-6" class="header-anchor">#</a> Typical duration of treatment:</h3> <p>1-3 weeks.</p> <h3 id="outcome-6"><a href="#outcome-6" class="header-anchor">#</a> Outcome:</h3> <p>Zero mortality among at least 4000 patients in the doctor's own modestly-equipped clinical practice in rural South Africa.</p> <p><strong>The protocol produced consistent outcomes, no sequelae and rapid recovery of all patients.

However the presenting symptoms have changed. The first wave was more respiratory, and the second wave was more gastrointestinal with the South African variant, and <strong>with the Delta variant, the disease pathology reverted to being predominantly respiratory, with much more involvement of the upper respiratory tract and presentation with sinusitis and otitis, sore throats. In the third Delta wave, very few patients developed the persistent coughs that were prevalent in the first wave. The initial symptoms of the disease have evolved a little bit; the typical loss of smell and taste were not so common, but Dr. Chetty observed many patients present with these symptoms on the 8th day. Therefore these symptoms were used in the Delta variant wave to recognize the onset of the second phase of the illness.</strong></p> <p><strong>Treatment modality</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>In the first wave, both HCQ and Ivermectin had helped in the early viral phase</strong> to decrease viral loads in patients that were severely ill. Unfortunately, these medicines weren't readily available to be used on almost every patient, and were used judiciously in those patients with severe body aches and other symptoms suggesting a high viral load. The HCQ and Ivermectin appeared to help curtail the symptoms and produce reasonable recovery in 2-3 days.</li> <li><strong>In the second wave, HCQ didn't appear to help at all in the early viral phase but Ivermectin was effective.</strong></li> <li><strong>In the third wave and with the Delta variant, once more, the patients with high viral loads appeared to respond to HCQ, 200 mg, twice a day. In the second part of the illness, patients, as before, start to desaturate. In both the second and third waves, decrease in oxygen seemed to be delayed a little, but if treatment waited on the decrease in oxygen levels to appear, they missed the boat. So it became necessary to educate the patient about other symptoms that appeared on the 8th day, and present in time for treatment. One such commonest symptom was overwhelming fatigue, which was an important sign of deterioration into the second phase. With the Delta variant, coagulopathy was a lot more prevalent.</strong></li> <li><strong>In the first and second and also third waves, it was observed that if the hypersensitivity was curtailed very early and aggressively, that negated any further illness since patients didn't succumb into the hyperinflammatory phase of the illness and the hypercoagulopathy. For those patients who presented late with the symptoms, or weren't treated appropriately or aggressively enough, the inflammatory markers were sky-high by the 11th day, and the patient began to present with hyperinflammatory symptoms and treatment with steroids becomes very important. Their D-dimer levels rose rapidly by the 13th or 14th day, even in those patients in which the other biomarkers were brought under control. Therefore it has become very important to anticoagulate patients in this Delta variant wave.</strong></li></ul> <p><strong>Different disease pathology and progression, in the third / Delta variant wave, with vaccinated patients:</strong> These patients presented a &quot;whole curve ball&quot; to what was seen with the unvaccinated patients, and especially patients who had taken the mRNA vaccine by Pfizer, as opposed to Johnson &amp; Johnson's adenovirus vector DNA vaccine. Patients who had taken the vaccines presented with unusual symptoms. With the J&amp;J vaccines, the patients presented with very quick side effects like headaches and other side effects of vaccination, usually a day after vaccination, which took 3-4 days to subside. <strong>However with the mRNA vaccines, a large proportion of patients developed Covid-like illness 7-10 days after vaccination, and presented with all the symptoms of Covid- body aches, sore throats, fever etc. Therefore it had become very important to know the vaccination status of patients and note the timeline of onset of illness from the vaccination itself. Strangely, these patients who developed Covid-like symptoms 7-10 days after vaccination would decline within 3-4 days of presenting with symptoms, and develop hypoxic illness, requiring hospitalization, very early on.</strong> This was never seen with unvaccinated patients who had acquired the infection naturally.</p> <p><strong>From these observations and from the prior inference that the 8th day symptoms were in fact a reaction to the spike protein, Dr. Chetty concluded that the vaccinated patients who were presenting with symptoms 7-10 days after vaccination were, in fact, presenting on the equivalent of the 8th day of the timeline of their natural disease progression</strong>, or in other words, the 1st day of Covid-like respiratory symptoms after vaccination was in fact the 8th day on the scale of the natural infection. <strong>Thus, it was concluded that the patients who were presenting with desaturation on the 3rd or 4th day after presenting with symptoms were actually on the 12th or 13th day of the natural disease timeline, since the initial viral phase of the illness was now negated or precluded as these symptoms were not the result of infection but a &quot;spike protein illness&quot; induced in the body by the vaccines.</strong> This illness or response to the spike proteins would, if left unchecked, devolve very quickly into a cytokine storm, coagulation problems anda other forms of hyperinflammation. <strong>Therefore, the 8th Day Therapy, with antihistamines, Monteleukast, steroids and anticoagulants, was once again recruited to treat patients developing hypoxia and Covid-like symptoms 7-10 days post vaccination. Moreover, their inflammation markers like CRP and interleukins were tested early on after presenting with symptoms, and this too was found to be useful.</strong></p> <p><strong>Those patients who presented with Covid symptoms over a month after vaccination were likely to be truly suffering from the breakthrough illness.</strong> These patients, or a majority of them, did indeed follow the same natural disease progression timeline that was seen in unvaccinated patients. However there was a unique feature in the pathology of the breakthrough cases. <strong>With some of these cases, perhaps a minority, the patient would look normal on the 8th day, and also on the 9th and 10th, but a few days after the 8th day, when everything seemed fine, the patient would unexpectedly desaturate. In these cases of delayed or deferred desaturation in some vaccinated Covid patients, the desaturation would be rapid and severe and seemed like the most severe of Covid cases that Dr. Chetty had classified.</strong> Dr. Chetty therefore conferred with his colleagues in India, who had observed a similar odd evolution of disease pathology in their vaccinated patients, and it is inferred that in the vaccinated patients, the body had developed a measure of tolerance to the spike protein, which delayed the onset of the inflammation and hypersensitivity by a few days, until the initial tolerance was overcome. If they did react, the patients that had a propensity to react severely would react very severely.</p> <p><strong>Therefore it is crucial that the patients be triaged by their vaccination status and treated appropriately. Some of these severe infections may indeed be due to antibody dependent enhancement, as seen with animal models in the testing of these vaccines.</strong></p> <h3 id="typical-duration-of-treatment-7"><a href="#typical-duration-of-treatment-7" class="header-anchor">#</a> Typical duration of treatment:</h3> <p>About 1-3 weeks for recovery and 1-4 weeks for completion of treatment course, if correctly treated using the protocol for the Delta variant.</p> <h3 id="outcome-7"><a href="#outcome-7" class="header-anchor">#</a> Outcome:</h3> <p>Effective mitigation of the Delta variant of Covid-19, with a nearly complete cure rate.</p> <h3 id="significant-side-effects-8"><a href="#significant-side-effects-8" class="header-anchor">#</a> Significant side effects:</h3> <p>No significant side effects reported with therapeutic dosages.</p> <h3 id="recommended-quantity-for-stocking-8"><a href="#recommended-quantity-for-stocking-8" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recommended quantity for stocking:</h3> <p>Treatment can be undertaken only under doctor's guidance and supervision.</p> <h3 id="price-8"><a href="#price-8" class="header-anchor">#</a> Price:</h3> <p>The medicines used are available in local pharmacies and inexpensive.</p> <h3 id="suggested-suppliers-8"><a href="#suggested-suppliers-8" class="header-anchor">#</a> Suggested suppliers:</h3> <p>Local pharmaceutical stores.</p> <h3 id="further-references-8"><a href="#further-references-8" class="header-anchor">#</a> Further references:</h3> <ul><li><a href="https://www.onedaymd.com/2021/08/what-countries-are-using-ivermectin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistical support for the efficacy of Ivermectin-based protocols, from around the world<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></li> <li><a href="https://covexit.com/the-early-treatment-of-the-delta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Early Treatment of the Delta: A Webinar Held on August 21, 2021 With Drs.

[THEMA Report]</p> <p><strong>Dr. Borody developed and released the Covid-19 Triple Therapy treatment protocol to Australian GPs, who can legally prescribe it to their COVID-19 positive patients.</strong> They can also prescribe it as a preventative medication.

GPs can email GP@CDD.com.au to obtain the dosing protocol and COVID-19 treatment information for their patients. GPs can legally prescribe the therapy today as an 'off label' treatment according to Australian Guidelines – a standard practice in medicine.</strong> In fact more than 60% of prescriptions in Australia are 'off-label'.

The doctor visited the houses of outpatients and now has added a volunteer-managed telemedicine portal to help offer his services to more people. He is linked to a network of 100s of likeminded physicians, who work together to evolve and propagate better early treatment protocols. Currently, an app is being developed to support other physicians in early treatment.</p> <p>When HCQ, then the mainstay of the treatment protocol was banned in Italy about 2 months into the pandemic, Dr. Stramezzi filed a legal petition to have the ban revoked. Though the case was overruled by the Court, an important victory was nonetheless won in that the Court allowed that physicians should be allowed to determine their mode of treatment.</p> <h3 id="protocol-and-treatment-approach-10"><a href="#protocol-and-treatment-approach-10" class="header-anchor">#</a> Protocol and treatment approach:</h3> <p>The principles of Dr. Stramezzi's protocol are briefly outlined as follows:</p> <ol><li>The first principle of the protocol is to <strong>begin treatment at the earliest after the onset of symptoms.</strong></li> <li><strong>Hydroxychloroquine</strong> was used since the early days of the treatment, but now <strong>Ivermectin</strong> is preferred as the treatment of choice when available, due to its efficacy at stopping viral replication. However Ivermectin is more difficult to obtain in Italy due to its approval there only for veterinary use, and must be procured from certain countries of the EU, such as France, where its human use is legal. HCQ was found to work its best in the first days of the infection, whereas <strong>Ivermectin was found to work well at all stages of the disease, and even for long Covid.</strong> Dr. Stramezzi prefers to start with Ivermectin in early treatment if it is available.</li> <li>Antiinflammatory drug like <strong>Acetyl Salicylic Acid (Aspirin)</strong> is very important to prevent viral pneumonia. The virus colonizes all tissues, and so anti-inflammatory medication is crucial, and another drug used is <strong>Bromexine</strong>.</li> <li>The virus also replicates in the gut microbiota, and so it is important to use <strong>antibiotics</strong>.</li> <li>In some patients- in fact, in about 10 % patients with a naive infection, i.e.,who are infected for the first time- the infection triggers a severe autoimmune condition called the cytokine storm after 14-15 days, when the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that were produced start to decline.

Rick Perry's Health Disparities Task Force. He has reported a 100 % cure rate with the Inhaled Budesonide early treatment protocol, since March, 2020. In April 2021, The Lancet reported evidence of inhaled budesonide, UK’s first effective drug to treat COVID-19 in patients at home, showing the treatment can reduce recovery time by a median of three days. The treatment has since been included in clinical guidelines for treating early-stage COVID-19 across the UK, Canada and India.</p> <p>Dr. Richard Bartlett shared with ACWT (America Can We Talk) about how asthma medicine Budesonide emptied a hospital ICU after being used to treat coronavirus.</p> <p>A very similar COVID-19 protocol has been used with great success in Japan, Taiwan and Singapore. Mortality rates in those countries have been kept extremely low for months after seeing major early outbreaks.</p> <p>Having said that, several prominent doctors, including Dr. Pierre Kory of the FLCCC, do not report that Budesonide in the way that it was used by them in their therapeutic protocols, played a major role in recovery.</p> <h3 id="protocol-and-treatment-approach-11"><a href="#protocol-and-treatment-approach-11" class="header-anchor">#</a> Protocol and treatment approach:</h3> <p><strong>Dr. Bartlett's coronavirus protocol is simple and two-fold:</strong></p> <ol><li><strong>First, individuals who suspect they have been infected should get tested for COVID-19 as soon as possible so they can be treated early in the disease process.</strong></li> <li><strong>Secondly, a specific protocol should be followed that uses a nebulizer to deliver the steroid medication Budesonide deep into the lungs at the source of the infection.</strong>
The protocol hinges on the use of <strong>Budesonide, a commonly used inexpensive inhaled drug for asthma, Zinc and Clarithromycin to suppress secondary infection</strong> as the inhaled steroid would suppress the immune system. The following is one published Budesonide protocol:</li></ol> <ul><li><strong>Budesonide 0.5-1 mg / 2 ml respules</strong> <ul><li>Sig:1 respule q 2 hours PRN severe symptoms</li> <li>Dispense 2 boxes</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Clarithromycin</strong> 500 mg
<ul><li>Sig: 1 Tab Orally, Twice daily, With food</li> <li>Dispense 14. Refills X 1</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Zinc</strong> 50 mg
<ul><li>Sig: 1 Orally, Once daily</li> <li>Dispense 30 Refills X 1</li></ul></li></ul> <p><strong>For Adults</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Coated <strong>Aspirin</strong> 81 mg
<ul><li>Sig: 1 Orally, Once daily</li> <li>Dispense 90 Refills X 3</li></ul></li></ul> <p><strong><ins>The Budesonide powder-inhalation Protocol validated through the Oxford RCT:</ins></strong></p> <ul><li><p><strong>Inhaled budesonide powder (Pulmicort)</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>180 mcg/puff, 3 puffs tid = 1,620 mcg/day</strong></li> <li><strong>One Pulmicort 180 mcg/puff Flexhaler provides 120 puffs, sufficient for 13.3 days.</strong></li> <li><strong>OR 400 mcg/puff, 2 puffs bid = 1,600 mcg/day</strong></li></ul> <p><strong>One Pulmicort 400 mcg / puff Turbohaler provides 50 puffs, sufficient for 12.5 days.</strong> The systemic effect looks equivalent to ~51 mg oral hydrocortisone, consistent with what would be needed to properly regulate the immune response in the absence of a robust endogenous adrenal cortisol stress response. Dosage in this optimal range will likely be key: Just enough to replicate a more optimal adrenal cortisol response and put a light hand brake on the inflammatory response but not so much it over-suppresses immune function.</p></li> <li><p><strong>ASA 325 mg/day (to help counter COVID’s pro-thrombotic effect) etc. at provider’s discretion.</strong></p></li></ul> <p><strong>Potentially helpful nutraceuticals:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Vitamin D3 10,000 IU/day. After recovery, reduce to 5,000 IU/day and maintain long-term.</strong></li> <li><strong>Zinc 50 mg/day elemental</strong></li> <li><strong>Quercetin 500 mg bid (zinc ionophore; to enhance Zn antiviral effect)</strong></li> <li><strong>Vitamin C 3,000 mg/day</strong></li> <li><strong>Melatonin 1 - 3 mg at bedtime (antiviral; may be added pro re nata, i.e., as needed, as it can cause daytime drowsiness).</strong></li></ul> <p>(<strong>Note</strong>: When supplementing with vitamin D, it is <strong>important also to supplement with vitamin K2.</strong>)</p> <h3 id="typical-duration-of-treatment-10"><a href="#typical-duration-of-treatment-10" class="header-anchor">#</a> Typical duration of treatment:</h3> <p>Recovery duration reported to be reduced by a median of 3 days.</p> <h3 id="outcome-10"><a href="#outcome-10" class="header-anchor">#</a> Outcome:</h3> <p>Dr. Bartlett reported excellent outcomes with the treatment in clinical trials. The Oxford STOIC phase 2 randomized study confirmed that early treatment with inhaled Budesonide reduced the need for hospitalization by 90%. Researchers found that when Budesonide was administered within seven days of the onset of symptoms, recovery time was also reduced.</p> <p><strong>Excerpt from a report on the Oxford RCT:</strong>
THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD on February 8, 2021 released its “Steroids in COVID-19” (STOIC) randomized controlled trial of inhaled Budesonide powder (Pulmicort) for treatment of early
outpatient COVID-19. Beginning an average 3 days after symptom onset, inhaled Budesonide, 400 mcg/puff, 2 puffs bid (twice in a day) was taken for a median duration of 7 (4 to 10.5) days. Urgent care visits &amp; hospital admissions were 90% lower compared to usual care (P = 0.004). The trial was designed around a hoped-for 50% reduction in risk. However, because the actual result was a 90% reduction, the trial achieved statistical significance sooner than expected. On December 9, the study team requested an independent statistical monitoring committee review, on the basis of which the trial was concluded early. One of the reasons given was “ethical consideration of the primary outcome.</p> <p><strong>“We stopped early because, how could we ethically randomise participants to the nonbudesonide arm knowing they had a 10-fold chance of needing hospitalisation? This, in addition to knowing that people recover faster in the budesonide arm, have lower fevers, report less congestive symptoms, etc.”</strong> — Dan V.

There are a large number of research publications now supporting these recommendations.</p> <h3 id="protocol-and-treatment-approach-12"><a href="#protocol-and-treatment-approach-12" class="header-anchor">#</a> Protocol and treatment approach:</h3> <p><strong><ins>The early treatment of the Delta variant:</ins></strong></p> <p>With the <strong>Delta variant</strong>, both vaccinated and unvaccinated persons are at risk, and this variant spreads faster, being estimated to be 40-60 % more transmissible. The symptoms start sooner and are slightly different from the original symptoms associated with Covid-19 in the first wave in 2020. They are fever, sore throat, cough, runny nose, headache, loose GI. The loss of smell is not as common as with the other variants. The Delta variant is escaping vaccine immunity and great surge of infections in countries with high vaccination rates, like Gibraltar, Iceland, UK, Israel, Seychelles, Australia etc. The viral load is higher, but the infection is not necessarily deadlier as infections historically have mutated to become more transmissible but less deadly. This appears to be true of the Delta variant as well, which is now predominant in North Americal, as 90 % of SARS-CoV-2 infections.</p> <p><strong>The greatest predictor of outcome in Covid infections: Overall immune health, and pre-infection levels of Vitamin D, which is really a pro-hormone</strong>, which affects many genes and cell signalling pathways. A lookback study conducted on 191,000 patients by a corporate laboratory, the SARS-CoV-2 test positivity rate is tightly correlated with  vitamin D levels, with TPR being nearly 12 % among those with vitamin D levels around 20 ng/mL, and dropping to 5-7 % among those with D levels above 50 ng/mL. This is significant in the colder countries as they head towards the winter season with low sunshine. With a healthy vitamin D level, even those who do get infected are significantly less likely to express severe symptoms.</p> <p>(<strong>Note</strong>: When supplementing with vitamin D, it is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122030624X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">important also to supplement with vitamin K2<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>.)</p> <p><strong>The comorbidities that pose the highest risk of needing hospitalization and intensive care with the Delta variant:</strong></p> <ol><li><strong>Obesity</strong></li> <li><strong>Fear and anxiety disorders</strong></li> <li><strong>Diabetes with complications</strong></li> <li><strong>Chronic Kidney Disease</strong></li> <li><strong>Neurocognitive disorders</strong></li> <li><strong>COPD</strong></li> <li>Aplastic anaemia</li> <li>Coronary artery disease etc.

Research published in the journal Vascular Pharmacology shows that a molecule found in Nigella sativa, also known as Black seed or Black cumin (Kalonji / Krishnajeera / Karunjeerakam), binds to ACE2 receptors in the lungs, potentially stopping spike protein particles from inducing inflammation and vascular damage. The molecule is being studied for possible drug development. Researchers out of India investigated the effects of Nigellidine, an Indazole alkaloid of Black seed, using molecular docking for binding to different angiotensin-binding proteins, as well as the spike glycoprotein. They found that Nigellidine “strongly binds” to the spike protein at what is known as the hinge region or active site opening, which may in turn hamper its binding to ACE2 receptor surfaces.</li></ul> <hr> <p><strong>Recommended ingredients for nutritionist Mr. David Wolfe's Spike Protein Protocol:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Nutrient supplements:</strong> <ul><li>Zinc (30-80 mg per day depending on immunological pressure).</li> <li>Vitamin D3 (Note: Vitamin D supplementation best <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122030624X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accompanied by supplementation with K2<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29480918/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnesium<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> for better action and bioavailability).</li> <li>Nattokinase, a fermented soybean derivate that is known to protect the cardiovascular system from developing a bloodclotting cascade (4000 Fibrinolytic Units twice per day or 200 mg twice per day).</li> <li>Lypospheric Vitamin C (30 ml, twice a day).</li> <li>Quercetin (500-1000 mg, twice a day).</li> <li>Iodine</li> <li>PQQ</li> <li>C60 (1-3 droppersful per day), which is claimed to counteract the differential magnetization of the injected site, and the C60 SuperConcentrate is particularly recommended.</li> <li>Charcoal as an excellent detoxifier (2-4 capsules a day, on an empty stomach to activate a blood purification process known as intestitial dialysis), especially the product Kohlbitr, sold on Mr. Wolfe's e-commerce website, that is said to be a premium brand of coconut charcoal, or the more gentle birch charcoal.</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Superherbs:</strong> <ul><li>Pine needle tea for shikimic acid or shikimate and their derivates that have cancer-fighting, antiviral, antimicrobial, anticoagulant and antithrombotic properties (prepared only from green, edible, i.e. nontoxic, pine needles, the tea to be along with the oil / resin that accumulates).</li> <li>Fennel and / or Star anise tea, which are also an exceellent source of shikimate or shikimic aicd which are known to cause the spike protein to be neutralized.</li> <li>Citrus fruit, and especially blood oranges for their high content of hesperidin, which is a chalcone-like quercetin that deactivates spike proteins.</li> <li>Peppermint, very high in hesperidin.</li> <li>Wheatgrass and Wheatgrass juice, of which the blades are high in shikimate.</li> <li>Triphala formulations in Ayurveda (a combination of Indian gooseberry or Amla, black myrobalan and bellerIc myrobalan).</li> <li>St. John's wort, the entire plant.</li> <li>Comfrey leaf.</li> <li>Feverfew, of which the leaves and flowers are suitable for this use.</li> <li>Gingko biloba leaf.</li> <li>Giant hyssop or Horsemint or Agastache urtifolia.</li> <li>Liquid ambar or Sweet gum tree, of which a tea might be prepared with the spiky seed pods, which all are exceptionally rich in shikimate.</li></ul></li></ul> <hr> <p><strong>Dr. Mercola's Protocol for neutralizing the spike protein:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>From Dr. Mercola's perspective, the best thing one can do is to build the innate immune system.

All vegetable oils and processed foods must be avoided. and only certified-organic foods consumed to minimize glyphosate exposure. Plenty of sulfur-rich foods must be included in the diet to keep mitochondria and lysosomes healthy. Both are important for the clearing of cellular debris, including these spike proteins.</strong></li> <li><strong>Sulfate levels can also be boosted by taking Epsom salt baths. Sauna therapy</strong>, which upregulates heat shock proteins, will help refold misfolded proteins and also tag damaged proteins and target them for removal.

Conventional nuclear images rely on human visual observation for subjective or &quot;guestimate&quot; evaluations. The Fleming Method uses a complex, yet simple method of camera recalibration to turn images into numerical computations removing the human subjective evaluation and associated error. Unlike common nuclear imaging protocols that require two injections of a nuclear isotope, the Fleming Method many times only requires one injection reducing patient venous punctures and radiation exposure.​ Dr. Richard M. Fleming, inventor of Fleming Method calibration, measurement, and imaging patent, recognized that many of these isotopes can be measured sooner than previously expected.  This method enables the identification of conditions such as critical heart disease, cancers, and infections such as COVID-19.  The Fleming Method uses existing FDA approved devices and drugs to provide the computational evaluation to help determine severity of conditions otherwise missed with conventional methods. The Fleming Method is a paradigm shift in nuclear imaging reducing scanning times in some instances by hours with use of existing equipment.</p> <p>The Fleming method was used in a large clinical trial involving over 500 patients across the world in which a large number of allopathic treatment modalities were assessed for efficacy using the FMTVDM, with deference to the particcipating physicians' discretion in choosing the treatment modality that they thought would best suit their patients. From these studies, certain treatment modalities fared better than others and the most effective of these modalities are described below:</p> <p><strong><ins>The FMTVDM-directed Covid-19 Treatment Protocol:</ins></strong> <strong>In the outpatient setting, begins with stabilizing the immune response and opening airways to improve oxygenation:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>I. Immune support to stabilize the immune response:</strong> <ul><li>Folate (B9)) 3 mg by mouth daily</li> <li>Magnesium 400 mg by mouth daily</li> <li>Calcium carbonate 400 mg by mouth daily</li> <li>Cobalamin (B12) 3 mg by mouth daily</li> <li>Pyridoxine (B6) 30 mg by mouth daily</li> <li>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) 50 mg by mouth daily</li> <li>Ascorbic acid (C) 2000 mg by mouth daily</li> <li>Zinc 10 mg by mouth daily</li> <li>1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol (D3) 1500 IU by mouth daily</li></ul></li> <li><strong>II. Respiratory support to open airways and improve oxygenation:</strong> <ul><li>Atrovent nebulizer or inhaler, 2 puffs every 4 hours
<em>The third component of treatment in the outpatient setting includes Aminoquinolines and antibiotics.</em></li></ul></li> <li><strong>III. Aminoquinolines and Antibiotics, that reduce viral attachment to cells and reduce viral replication (but not to address seccondary bacterial infection):</strong> <ul><li><strong>i) 100 % effective treatment strategy:</strong> <ul><li>Primaquine 200 mg by mouth on Day 1.</li> <li>Clindamycin 150 mg by mouth every 6 hours for 7 days</li> <li>Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg by mouth every 8 hours for 10 days.</li></ul></li> <li><strong>ii) 97.9 % effective:</strong> <ul><li>Clindamycin 150 mg by mouth every 6 hours for 7 days.</li> <li>Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg by mouth every 8 hours for 10 days.</li></ul></li> <li><strong>iii) 74.2 % effective:</strong> <ul><li>Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg by mouth every 8 hours for 10 days.</li> <li>Azithromycin 500 mg by mouth on Day 1, then 250 mg by mouth on days 2 through 5.</li></ul></li> <li><strong>iv) 69.1 % effective:</strong> <ul><li>Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg by mouth every 8 hours for 10 days.</li> <li>Doxycycline 100 mg by mouth every 12 hours for 10 days.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul> <p><strong>The adaptation of this treatment regimen to inpatients in the hospital setting:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>The 3 different Regimens:</strong> <ul><li><strong>Case 1) If prior Aminoquinoline treatment has been provided, adopt the following two treatment Regimens:</strong> <ul><li><strong>Regimen 1:</strong> <ul><li>Methylprednisolone 125 mg IntraVenously every 6 hours for 3 days.</li> <li>Then 125 mg IV every 12 hours for 2 days.</li> <li>Then 125 mg IV daily for 2 days.</li> <li>Then 60 mg IV daily for 2 days (with each infusion administered over 30 minutes).</li> <li>Then Solumedrol dose pack to taper off steroids.</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Regimen 2:</strong> <ul><li>Tocilizumab 8 mg / kg (IBW, i.e. Ideal Body Weight), not to exceed 800 mg intravenously infused over 1 hour.

Chlorine dioxide has 2.6 times the oxidizing power of waterborne Chlorine, does not react with water and is effective over a wide range of pH, is considered an excellent bactericide, fungicide and antimicrobial agent, and has been FDA-approved as a sanitizer in food processing plants. Unlike bleach and Chlorine, which break down to carcinogenic byproducts like trihalomethanes, Chlorine dioxide donates Oxygen, and breaks down to water and salts.

Sodium chlorite or MMS solution should never touch metal. Don’t stir with a metal spoon, or use metal bowls to mix, or metal containers to store—this includes stainless steel. Storage containers / bottles for MMS should have plastic lids, not metal, as the sodium chlorite will eventually eat through and corrode the metal. The metal starts eating into the lid and it starts dropping down in to your MMS. This will introduce metal in the MMS and this is poisonous.</li> <li>Storage containers for MMS (22.4% solution of sodium chlorite in distilled water) should preferably be glass. Tinted glass such as amber color or green is best. If you must use plastic a good quality plastic that is HDPE plastic is best.</li></ul> <p><strong>Step 1: Making Master Mineral Solution:</strong> <strong>MMS is made from distilled Water, widely available Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl, or bleach), a sensitive weighing balance, a food-grade acid like citric acid, and a non-reactive storage container. MMS is a 22.4% solution of sodium chlorite in water.</strong> One hundred milliliters of MMS liquid should weigh 122 grams, this is the ideal. If it falls in the range of 120 grams to 124 grams it is usable, but 122 grams, or very close to it, is best.
<strong>Step 2: Preparing activated MMS, or Chlorine dioxide solution:</strong>
MMS Protocols for health recovery call for “activated MMS”. MMS needs a food-grade acid to activate it and the two combined produce chlorine dioxide. There are several acids that can activate MMS, including the juice of a fresh lemon or lime, or vinegar. However, we most often use either 50% citric acid, or 4% HCl (hydrochloric acid). When using these two acids in these percentages always use 1 drop of acid to 1 drop of MMS. Both of these acids, in these percentages, are a 1-to-1 ratio with MMS. In other words, mix 1 drop of either of 50% citric acid or 1 drop of 4% HCl, to every 1 drop of MMS. The standard activation time for mixing these drop-for-drop doses using 50% citric acid or 4% HCl is 30 seconds. <a href="https://jimhumblebooks.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See the MMS Health Recovery Guidebook for full instructions on how to mix and use MMS<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>.

In a study on drinking water in the Netherlands, Jin et al. found that treatment with ClO2 at concentrations of 0.5 ppm for 25 minutes, or 1.5 ppm for 10 minutes, or 2 ppm for 5 minutes achieved at least a 4 log reduction of enterovirus. Schijven et al. demonstrated that municipal drinking water treated with ClO2 (0.1 ppm in summer and 0.05 ppm in winter) significantly reduced adenovirus levels to levels that are considered safe for drinking water. Alvarez and O'Brien found a ClO2 concentration of 40 ppm added to wastewater seeded with SARS-CoV that completely inactivated the SARS-CoV in 30 minutes. The dose used in this research is 30 mg per day for 21 days, which is well below the NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effect Level), or in the worst case the same as the NOAEL.&quot;</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/determination-of-the-effectiveness-of-chlorine-dioxide-in-the-treatment-of-covid19-67319.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Determination of the Effectiveness of Chlorine Dioxide in the Treatment of COVID-19; Insignares-Carrione Eduardo et al.; Molecular and Genetic Medicine; 2021<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></li></ul> <p><a href="https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/determination-of-the-effectiveness-of-chlorine-dioxide-in-the-treatment-of-covid19-67319.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In the Bolivian study<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> (which was in fact, conducted on 20 patient volunteers whose informed consent was sought, from <strong>Bolivia, Equador, Mexico and Peru, but officially conducted in Bolivia</strong>, due to legal ethical restrictions on therapeutic use of CDS in other countries), <strong>the base medication used is Chlorine dioxide 3000 ppm in × 120 cc bottles marked with a planned label and administered according to the standard established in the research protocol, and each patient received the therapeutic dosage of CDS medication exclusively (i.e., not as adjunct therapy)</strong>, whereas the control group received Standard Of Care treatment with anti-inflammatory medication (Ibuprofen), antibiotics (Azithromycin), antihistamines (Hydrazine), corticosteroids (Methylprednisolone) and other supportive care.

They have also misreported that the treatment involved the therapeutic use of bleach / NaClO / Sodium hypochlorite, whereas in fact CDS / Chlorine Dioxide Solution was used. Moreover, some reported adverse effects were owing to prophylactic use of CDS, <a href="https://vitalitymagazine.com/article/covid-19-how-can-i-cure-thee-let-me-count-the-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whereas CDS is not intended to be used as prophylactic, only to mitigate infection:<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></p> <ul><li><a href="https://health-desk.org/articles/why-is-chlorine-dioxide-dangerous-if-taken-for-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Health Desk: Why is chlorine dioxide dangerous if taken for COVID-19?;

Considering that human cells are not isolated but form tissues, their Glutathione stock may be many orders of magnitude greater than that of a planktonic bacterium. However, continuous ClO2 entry can ﬁnally exhaust the cell's Glutathione (and other antioxidant) capacity even if the cell produces such antioxidants continuously. At this point, ClO2 can enter into the previously protected zones of the cell and react with the reactive amino acid residues, causing denaturation of the affected proteins and ultimately cell death.</p> <p><strong>The research article therefore might be interpreted to suggest that supplementing with Glutathione / N-Acetyl Cysteine might help to further decrease the cytotoxic effects of CDS for human cells</strong>:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340247214_Can_chlorine_dioxide_prevent_the_spreading_of_coronavirus_or_other_viral_infections_Medical_hypotheses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can chlorine dioxide prevent the spreading of coronavirus or other viral infections?

When chlorine dioxide comes in contact with a virus, a single, highly reactive nascent oxygen atom is released on the target virus. This oxygen binds to specific amino acids in the protein coat of the virus, denaturing the proteins and rendering the virus inactive. Additionally, nascent oxygen atoms bind to guanine, one of the four nucleic acid bases found in RNA and DNA, forming 8-oxoguanine.

References):</strong> There is historical evidence from the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, during which it was reported in one anonymous editorial that the Massachusetts State Health Department found sunlight therapy to be “the most valuable factor in reducing mortality,” decreasing fatality of hospitalized patients from 40% to 13%, boosting flu immunity among physicians and nurses, and overall, besting the outcome of vaccines, which were then in their early stages of development. Evidence indicates that available reports of the pandemic clearly show that sunlight was effective in reducing flu-related mortality and morbidity, and person-to-person infection. Patients with severe infections exposed to sunlight therapy outdoors recovered better than those treated indoors, and the treatment prevented death among patients and infections among the healthcare workers. Thus records indicate that, <strong>phototherapy, one of the most effective tools used to minimize the impact of the 1918 pandemic and other disease epidemics, has been overlooked.</strong></p> <p>There is also historical evidence that the ancient Egyptians, Mesopotamians, Babylonians, Greeks and Romans, and Africans too from ancient times, venerated the sun for its healing powers and practised sunbathing.</p> <p>Less than 25 years before the 1918 pandemic, a Danish physician, Dr. Niels Ryberg Finsen, had developed a light source that was successful in curing patients with skin tuberculosis (lupus vulgaris) and other ailments. Between 1896 and 1901, he treated as many as 804 patients with skin tuberculosis and similar microbial infections at his Medical Light Institute, achieving 83% cure rate. The Finsen lamp became widely popular and was adopted in most of Europe and North America, earning Finsen the Nobel Prize in 1903.</p> <p>Newer studies demonstrate that various wavelengths in the blue spectrum are antimicrobial against the deadly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, Acinetobacter baumannii, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Propionibacterium acnes, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and others. An analysis of the Nobel-winning work of Finsen, supports these blue light studies, because it shows that the Finsen Lamp, used to heal many with tuberculosis infection, did not produce UV as Finsen believed; rather, it produces light in the violet/blue range. Indeed, the Finsen Lamp could not have emitted UV because the type of glass used to construct its lenses does not transmit UV.</p> <p>There is a recent report that <strong>the common cold virus—a coronavirus—is inactivated by light. In this recent study, broad spectrum light—mimicking sunlight—was tested on aerosolized influenza virus at 20% and 70% relative humidity, while the decay constant and half-life of the virus were measured as indices of survival. The results showed that relative humidity had no effect. The simulated sunlight alone significantly inactivated the virus, resulting in 0.29 ± 0.09 min−1 decay constant and a half-life of approximately 2.4 min compared to non-irradiated controls, which had 0.02 ± 0.06 min−1 decay constant and 31.1 min half-life.

A part of the solar light spectrum lies in the range of ultraviolet (UV) radiation.  UV light is invisible because its wavelength is shorter than the violet wavelengths of the solar spectrum.  UV light is available year round in the tropics and during part of the year farther north and south.  UV is also produced by sun lamps.  There are three main wavelength ranges of UV light- UVA, UVB and UVC.  UV wavelengths are measured in nanometers (one billionth of a meter).</p> <ul><li>UVA has a wavelength of 380-315 nanometers and when contacting the skin can penetrate beyond the outer layer (epidermis) into a layer called the dermis. UVA does not stimulate vitamin D production.</li> <li><strong>UVB light has a wavelength of 315-290 nanometers and penetrates only the epidermis when it contacts the skin. UVB stimulates the skin, which then produces vitamin D.</strong></li> <li><strong>UVC light has a wavelength of 280-10 nanometers and is filtered out by the Earth’s outer atmosphere. It is an invisible part of the solar spectrum.</strong></li></ul> <p><strong>Of the three types of UV, it is UVB that stimulates the production of vitamin D when it contacts the skin.  Ninety percent of all vitamin D in human beings is produced by sunlight exposure. Vitamin D is vital to immune health.</strong> Although some vitamin D can be obtained through fish, eggs, mushrooms and other dietary sources, the amount is miniscule.  Vitamin D is also available through supplementation, which is also produced by the irradiation of lanolin by UVB. The only truly natural way to obtain vitamin D is through exposure to sunlight or other UVB sources.</p> <p><strong>Photobiomodulation (c.f. References):</strong> The development of lasers in the late 50s and the early 60s, and the subsequent evolution of light emitting diodes transformed phototherapy; it gave rise to laser therapy or light therapy, which, in turn, evolved into <strong>photobiomodulation</strong> as a variety of light-emitting technologies were devised. Today, photobiomodulation, which takes advantage of the photochemical effects of low power lasers, LEDs and other monochromatic sources of light to treat various diseases and ailments, has evolved scientifically, allowing evidence-based practice. This development now enables clinicians and others to exploit the specific effect of each wavelength or spectrum of light for treatment purposes. Advances in light technology and steady development of photobiomodulation through research and continual adaptation to evolving technologies have enabled science to uncover the beneficial effects of several spectra of light—in particular, violet/blue light, red light and near infrared light.</p> <p><strong>There are, in fact, several studies that show that we do not need UV to eradicate bacteria, viruses and other pathogens, and that relatively safer wavelengths adjacent to UV, such as violet or blue light, are antimicrobial against microorganisms. Furthermore, evidence shows that red and near-infrared light have immense therapeutic value as well, and may be effective in treating a range of ailments, including the respiratory complications of coronavirus disease. It is now known that light in the blue 400–470 nm range is antimicrobial against numerous bacteria and has the potential to mitigate opportunistic bacterial infections associated with COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections. Furthermore, as detailed below, laboratory experiments show that red and near infrared light, with wavelengths approximately in the range of 600–700 nm and 700–1000 nm respectively, have the potential to reduce lung inflammation and fibrosis, and hence acute respiratory disorder syndrome, a major cause of death in every coronavirus pandemic, including the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic.</strong></p> <p>A recent development buttresses the suggestion that <strong>blue light, in particular, pulsed blue light, which reports have shown to be 40 to 100 times more potent than the commonly available continuous wave blue light</strong>, has great potential to inactivate COVID-19 and other coronaviruses, in addition to suppressing related opportunistic bacterial infections.</p> <p><strong>Disinfection with Far-UV spectrum light (207–222 nm):</strong> A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because <strong>conventional UVC light sources are both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, research studies have previously shown that far-UVC light (207–222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (nonliving) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them.</strong></p> <p><strong>In 2018, a pioneering study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(David Welch et al.; Nature)<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> showed for the first time that far-UVC efficiently inactivates airborne aerosolized viruses, with a very low dose of 2 mJ/cm2 of 222-nm light inactivating &gt;95% of aerosolized H1N1 influenza virus.</strong> Continuous very low dose-rate far-UVC light in indoor public locations is a promising, safe and inexpensive tool to reduce the spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases.</p> <h3 id="typical-duration-of-treatment-18"><a href="#typical-duration-of-treatment-18" class="header-anchor">#</a> Typical duration of treatment:</h3> <p><strong>1-2 hours of phototherapy with sunlight, aka sunbathing, daily might be expected, in the light of historical evidence, to yield remarkable mitigation of influenza-like disease over 3-5 days of treatment.</strong> In fact, this simple technique has been long used in naturopathy and nature cure to reverse chronic, even debilitating and fatal ailments.</p> <p><strong>When far-UVC lighting is used to sanitize indoor and public spaces, it has been proposed that continuous very low dose-rate far-UVC light in indoor public locations is a promising, safe and inexpensive tool to reduce the spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases.</strong></p> <h3 id="outcome-18"><a href="#outcome-18" class="header-anchor">#</a> Outcome:</h3> <p>Highly effective mitigation of bacterial and viral infections, and especially pulmonary disease, through photobiomodulation and also by phototherapy with sunlight.</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/r2UTvCK0H823/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Stew Peters Show: UV Light Fixtures Would End COVID Tyranny, And They're Available Now!<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></li></ul> <h3 id="significant-side-effects-19"><a href="#significant-side-effects-19" class="header-anchor">#</a> Significant side effects:</h3> <p>No significant side effects to sunbathing, when the phototherapy is applied in therapeutic doses; very beneficial to holistic health.

Used as directed (i.e., rinsing the mouth and gargling and nasal wash, for 1 minute with prescribed concentrations), Hydrogen peroxide breaks down into water and oxygen in the mouth and is therefore very safe.

As a powerful oxidant, when Ozone comes into contact with blood or other body fluids, it releases reactive oxygen species (ROS), and lipid oxidation products (LOPs) both of which are responsible for the biological results. <strong>The main form of ROS is Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which is easily transferred from plasma into the cells. When H2O2 abruptly appears above the threshold medical concentration in the cytoplasm of cells it represents the triggering stimulus for the possibly simultaneous activation of different biochemical pathways in erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets in addition to other numerous biological effects, such as antimicrobial, immunostimulant, and antioxidant ones.</strong> H2O2 is then suddenly inactivated into water by the high concentration of Glutathione (GSH), Catalase (CAT), and Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) enzymatic systems, reducing its harmful potential.

Ozone water has a very short half life, so it is best if you drink it right after you make it in order for it to be as effective as possible. There really is no hard data on how much Ozone water a patient can or cannot drink as of this writing, but it is widely believed that Ozone water is not harmful. <strong>Make sure not to use a plastic cup to drink Ozone water as ozone can react to some materials. Glass or stainless steel cups are best.</strong> There are people who like it strong and others who like it very weak, so the titration part of Ozone water is critical to find what works best for each patient.</p> <p><strong>OZONE WATER COMPLICATIONS/THINGS TO LOOKOUT FOR:</strong>
Some patients can experience headaches or scratchy throat after drinking ozone water, if this happens to your patient, lower the Gamma and time by half for their next treatment or discontinue.</p> <h3 id="typical-duration-of-treatment-22"><a href="#typical-duration-of-treatment-22" class="header-anchor">#</a> Typical duration of treatment:</h3> <p>About 5-8 days, according to <a href="https://www.biospectrumindia.com/news/79/18317/ozone-therapy-making-greater-impact-in-controlling-covid-19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one clinical trial, announced by the Ozone Forum of India.<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></p> <h3 id="outcome-22"><a href="#outcome-22" class="header-anchor">#</a> Outcome:</h3> <p>Reportedly, relatively rapid recovery.</p> <ul><li><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/ozone-therapy-shows-77-success-in-covid-care-in-first-five-days-study-7102621/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indian Express: Ozone therapy shows 77% success in Covid care in first five days: Study; Dec 14, 2020<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> - “The use of ozone therapy in mild to moderate cases has shown 77 per cent success rate in the first five days,” Dr Mili Shah, vice-president, Ozone Forum of India, said at a press conference.</li> <li><a href="https://www.biospectrumindia.com/news/79/18317/ozone-therapy-making-greater-impact-in-controlling-covid-19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BioSpectrum reported<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>: &quot;A total of 500 patients (including across various comorbid conditions) out of which 77% have recovered within 5 days and the rest recovered by the 8th day as per clinical trials conducted in mid-2020.&quot;</li></ul> <h3 id="significant-side-effects-23"><a href="#significant-side-effects-23" class="header-anchor">#</a> Significant side effects:</h3> <p>No significant side effects reported in therapeutic dosages.</p> <h3 id="recommended-quantity-for-stocking-21"><a href="#recommended-quantity-for-stocking-21" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recommended quantity for stocking:</h3> <p>NA</p> <h3 id="price-23"><a href="#price-23" class="header-anchor">#</a> Price:</h3> <p>Inexpensive therapy.</p> <h3 id="suggested-suppliers-23"><a href="#suggested-suppliers-23" class="header-anchor">#</a> Suggested suppliers:</h3> <p><strong><ins>Ozone Forum of India:</ins></strong><br> <strong>Bisleri Charitable Trust, c/o Bisleri International Pvt.

She said she had been in close contact for hours with someone who was hospitalized the next day for COVID-19. But after waiting five days from the time of exposure, she tested negative for COVID.</li></ul> <p>Data suggests that specific drugs that bind SARS-CoV-2, or interacting host proteins, also have the potential to prevent COVID-19. For example, hydroxyzine is a first-generation antihistamine that exhibited off-target binding to the SARS-CoV-2 host receptor ACE2 and the sigma-1 receptor. Usage of hydroxyzine (and structurally related antihistamines diphenhydramine and azelastine) was associated with reduced incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in a population of more than 219,000 individuals in California. Hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine and azelastine exhibited direct antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells in vitro. Since antihistamines act as nasal decongestants and cough suppressants, the on- and off-target binding properties of drugs such as diphenhydramine may have broad utility in prevention and treatment of COVID-19.</p> <h3 id="typical-duration-of-treatment-23"><a href="#typical-duration-of-treatment-23" class="header-anchor">#</a> Typical duration of treatment:</h3> <p>Dr. Ostrov hopes that people may benefit from this antiviral drug combination for two-to-three month intervals during each wave of COVID infections.</p> <h3 id="outcome-23"><a href="#outcome-23" class="header-anchor">#</a> Outcome:</h3> <p>Dr. Ostrov's study, with early results showing <strong>99% efficacy</strong> in inhibiting replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was published in the journal <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/10/11/1514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pathogens<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>.</p> <h3 id="significant-side-effects-24"><a href="#significant-side-effects-24" class="header-anchor">#</a> Significant side effects:</h3> <p>Historically, there are relatively few adverse events reported for diphenhydramine and lactoferrin.</p> <p>People should consult with their physician before taking any drug “off-label,” meaning using a drug for a use other than its intended use.
